"""The meeting, read locally — brief, entities, topics, questions, answers.

The web app asks a cloud model; this reads the transcript itself and shows
receipts. The brief is extractive (the meeting's own sentences, chosen and
time-stamped, never paraphrased); entities are pattern-harvested; "ask the
meeting" is retrieval — it points at what was said, it doesn't make prose
up. Every card in the UI says which kind of reading it got.
