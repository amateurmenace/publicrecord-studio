"""Highlighter's name for the shared detection engine.

The scorer moved to czcore/moments.py (specs/12 §2: detection-as-a-service
— Publisher's clip candidates and Memory's issue engine call the same
scorer Highlighter always used). These explicit re-exports keep every
existing import working; new code should import czcore.moments directly.
