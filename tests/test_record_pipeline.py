"""The stage that turns a steward's yes into a meeting.

Until this module existed, `submissions.status='approved'` was a terminal state
dressed as a queue: the console wrote it, the schema declared `queued` and
`live` after it, and nothing anywhere selected it. So the cases that matter
most here are not the happy path — they are the four promises the pipeline
makes about rows it must *not* touch and states it must not skip.

**Nothing ingests without a human.** The drain reads `approved` and nothing
else. A `submitted` row is a submission nobody has looked at; a `rejected` row
is a steward's no. Both are invisible to this job, and that is the covenant's
"a human is in the middle" enforced by a WHERE clause rather than by a habit.

**A meeting with no captions is not a failure.** It parks in `asr_tasks` for
the desk drain and the submission says what it is waiting for. The ticket is
idempotent on the meeting, because a nightly re-run must not file the same work
twice.

**The link is written.** `submissions.meeting_id` has been in the schema since
the first migration and nothing had ever written it, which meant a steward
could see that a submission was approved and not get from there to the meeting.

The network is never touched: `memory.ingest.run` is replaced with a stand-in
in every case here, because what is under test is the queue's state machine,
not YouTube's caption service. The ingest engine itself is proven against both
stores by `tests/test_record_store_parity.py`.

Skips loudly without RECORD_TEST_PG_DSN.
