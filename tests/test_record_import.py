"""corpus.db → publicrecord, and the proof that nothing was re-derived.

specs/17 §11.3: the Brookline corpus was hand-audited, so the import carries it
rather than recomputing it. What that means concretely is testable — the
vectors survive bit-for-bit, the issue links keep the scores and the reasons
they were given, and the two stores agree on every rollup afterwards.

The fixture is a small corpus built the way the desk builds one, plus the two
awkward cases the real record actually contains: a segment whose text is pure
filler (a 1024-byte blob of zeros that must become NULL, because cosine
distance against a zero vector is undefined under pgvector), and an issue whose
name is a caption garble, which comes across unchanged because fixing it here
would make the import publicrecord's first unaudited edit.

Skips loudly without RECORD_TEST_PG_DSN — a skip is a gate that lost its
inputs, not routine.
