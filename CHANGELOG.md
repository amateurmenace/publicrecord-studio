### The civic broadsheet — the record as a front page, the tape as the sun, search as its spine — 2026-09-24 (v2.2.0)

Stephen's verdict on the site was that it was lifeless: too much text down
a single column, too stacked, too confusing. specs/29 answered with a
design, and this release presses it. The front page is a paper now, on a
twelve-column grid in Fraunces, IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono (self-hosted
in the edition; nothing loads from a third party). The masthead carries the
municipality switch and a READ stamp; under the wordmark the search spine —
a real form that reaches the search page with scripts off, six of the
record's own words to try, and the sentence that explains the page:
*everything you see is a search*. With the script on the spine answers as
you type, over the index that already ships with the edition — moments to
play, the meetings that took the word up, the threads, an over-time
sparkline — keyboard-first, and nothing leaves the browser.

Then the tape is the sun. Tonight's meeting opens as its frame, large, with
*Play from* its loudest moment and the caption under the playhead; beneath
it the score of the night — the tape as a timeline, the decisions as dots
sized by their weight, tension in rust, every dollar figure the room named
as a labelled tick, and eight lanes showing where each lens's words fell
(`analysis.framing.track`, sixty slices per lens, counted at press time
with the lenses' own word lists so a lane's bins sum to its lens's count).
Beside it the counted headline and lede, a *now at* card, and money named
on the tape; across it a filmstrip of three real frames from inside the
night with the decisions that fall in each. Click anything and the
playhead, the caption and the frame move together; on the meeting page the
same click seeks the video. The pictures are YouTube's own — the poster and
the three in-tape frames — fetched once by the press into `app/stills/`,
cached across pressings (the bucket seeds the cache), never hot-linked.

Below: the year in tapes, every meeting as its own still on the month axis,
sized by its hours, town-coloured on its top edge, with four chapters
written from the counts; four columns to delve into (two towns' vocabularies
as a butterfly, who and when as a dot matrix, the roll calls as a grid with
the one that failed in rust, the widest thread's season); how the talk
flowed, meeting by meeting, as a river of eight bands with a dashed line
where the second town joins; the front pages the press builds; this week;
the threads as small multiples; and the three doors into writing under the
rust line. Every picture is pressed SVG with its numbers beside it as
`data-bs-*` JSON — the reader re-lights it and the node twins hold the two
sides equal; every picture downloads as an .svg; with scripts off every
chart is a still and every control an anchor. The meeting page gets the
score as its jump bar and a pressed find box; the search page gets the
timeline of town-coloured dots and the reel with stills. The page stays
byte-clean of the studio, takes zero fuchsia, presses byte-identical, and
the constitution's ledger does not change: nothing new is written by a
model. Reviewed by four lenses, {FINDINGS}; {TESTS} tests.

### The verdict, read on a phone — the model's words whole, the search's numbers the story's, and the desk's last pieces in the paper — 2026-09-24 (v2.1.23)

Read on a phone, the live record was saying things that were not whole.
Every summary the Gemini lane wrote had stopped mid-sentence ("At the
September 22, 2026,"), and so had every drafted reading on every meeting:
Gemini's thinking spends from the same budget as its answer, the calls
asked for 400 and 700 tokens, and nothing asked why an answer stopped.
The seam now asks a thinking model to think briefly, gives the thought its
own room, and refuses any answer that did not end the way a whole answer
ends — a fragment is never pressed, and the extractive summary stands in
its place (specs/28). A one-off repair asks again for everything the
broken budget wrote. The readings' Markdown is read, not shown; their
receipts are links, said the way the page says a time. The "what changed"
paragraphs are the tape's own words: a model's was stored with no origin,
and two were on the front page, unlabeled and cut off.

The front page's "80 mentions" of AI opened a search that said 73; the
search page now counts a featured word by its story's own rule. Meaning
search, which had stopped answering inside the reader's bell (13–27 s on
the old database), answers in about a second on the resized one. On a
phone: the town question is asked once, and only where scope shapes the
page; the find box sits over the lines it folds; a shared reel leads with
its player; the keys sheet is centred; the tab strip names each story and
wraps two by two.

And the desk's last pieces, in the paper: a second featured word,
*housing*; every picture the press draws downloads as an .svg that says
how to read it; the tray's clips drag, by mouse or finger, the arrows
standing as the keyboard's way; a glossary of forty-seven civic words —
Select Board to Chapter 40B — each in plain language with its public
source and the record's own count of it town by town, the definitions
written with Claude and labeled so; and wherever a step needs the desk,
the desktop app's download beside it. Six adversarial reviews, every
finding folded with a test; five re-reviews of the folds and three of
theirs, and their 71 findings folded too — the gravest a repair that would
have overwritten every model answer on any failed call, now one that
changes nothing unless the model answered and was refused, writes a meeting
whole or not at all, and logs each row before it writes.

### The steward's desk — 2026-09-24 (v2.1.22)

The console grew from four screens into a desk (specs/27): the night as it
stands — what is running, with its own log lines; the record counted; the
chain step by step, each step with its last executions and a *Run now* —
every screen scoped to one municipality, the meetings on the record with
how much of each search can see, a log a steward can filter and an
execution's own sentences by name, the settings the night runs on with
where each is set, and a way back to the record from the header. 687
tests.

### A word, over time — the search told as a story, the supercut, the player's transport, and a search page that explains itself — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.21)

A citizen's question of the record is usually one word. The search page
answered with eighty lines and no shape; the reel — the record's most
powerful tool — hid behind an unlabeled tick; the front page told two
stories, neither of which showed what a search could become. Now **a search
is a story**, told three times. The press tells it for a featured word
(`web/topic.py`, specs/25): the front page leads with **How Brookline talks
about AI** — the first time anyone said it on the record and the two
meetings that passed without it, the night it peaked and how many minutes
that took, the mentions across the town's meetings and the bodies that
said them, the words said in the same breath, the latest word, and
Boston's, counted as elsewhere. Then the pictures: mentions month by month
with a dot per meeting (filled where the word came up, hollow where not),
one term across every tape slice by slice, the words beside it, the first
time it came up each night (each a cuttable moment), and **the supercut** —
one clip per night, and the full cut of every clip — in the viewer's own
link grammar, decoded by the reader's own decoder in a twin test. It closes
with how to make one: search a word, see how it was said, cut it and share
it. The story has its own page (`/app/topic/ai/`) and its plane; every
sentence is counted from the transcripts, never modeled, and says so.

The search page tells the same story live for any word (the JS twin of
the engine, held equal to the press by a node test): a progress line that
moves at real stages, a range switch (the last month · six months · a year ·
the whole record), the counted lede, **▶ play all as a reel**, **✂ put every
clip on my tray**, the link to the search; and an empty state that says in
three lines what a search can do here, with six of the record's own words
to try. The reel viewer grows the Highlighter's transport, in the paper:
prev · play/pause · next, the clip counter, a segment per clip that fills
with the tape's own time reports, keys, a share row, and an end card. The
search index's `meta.json` carries each tape's length now. Nothing touches
a server on the make path; nothing is stored; no model is used. An
adversarial review found fourteen defects — the story's own page never grew
its ticks, a malformed date could stop the press, a meeting with no town
could lead a story under an empty name, a replay was dead on an audio-only
first clip, the transport painted its own state instead of the tape's —
every one folded, with tests; the folds re-reviewed and six more folded
(a cite pressed while paused left the page; a segment pressed before play
on a reel across meetings loaded the wrong tape; "the latest" is a dated
night). 623 tests.

And the meeting page becomes the Highlighter's desk, in the paper
(specs/26): **the night, cut** — the press's reels from the meeting's own
moments, its five loudest in tape order and one reel per kind, as the
viewer's links under the tape and at the close of the front page's latest
story; **find in this meeting** — a find box over the transcript that folds
it to the lines that say the word, with a sparkline of where on the night
it fell, ▶ play the mentions as a reel and ✂ put them on my tray; **the
meeting in words** — the word cloud pressed on every meeting page, each
word a deep link and, with the script on, a find; **on this page** — a
jump bar of the sections the meeting has, the downloads with the kit; and
**?** — one sheet on every page that says what the keys do here. The
bodies filter moves under the front page's stories, beside the list it
filters. Reviewed the same way: eleven findings folded, the folds
re-reviewed, five more folded. 629 tests.

### The night lands every tape — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.20)

The first night with every switch on landed one meeting and then sat
silent for an hour: the embedding endpoint had slowed to a batch a minute,
one meeting's meaning vectors took longer than the job's hour, and a dozen
approved tapes behind it were never reached. A landed meeting now spends a
budget on its vectors (`RECORD_EMBED_BUDGET_S`, two minutes) and no longer
— it is on the record before that clock starts, the log names what is
left, and `record-embed`, now scheduled nightly, drains the backlog under
the spend cap. A job killed mid-ingest no longer strands its submission:
the next drain reclaims what a dead job left `queued`, and a shell nobody
has touched for an hour is not "already on the record". The nightly edition workflow was proven end to end (the
federated sign-in, the press from the cloud, the bucket sync); it no longer
commits a night whose only change is the press's own timestamp. 631 tests.

### A parked tape is asked again — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.19)

Brookline's meetings are live streams, and a live stream's auto captions
arrive hours after it ends: the first Brookline meeting the standing
pipeline reached parked honestly with no words, and nothing would ever
have asked again. The nightly drain now asks again for every meeting that
parked in the last week — the same three caption routes, the meeting's own
name and day kept — closes its drain ticket when the words land, embeds it
like any other, and says plainly what is still waiting. 602 tests.

### A hosted meeting keeps its name, and the reading is drafted — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.18)

The first meetings ingested through the standing pipeline landed as their
video id, undated: the caption relay brings the words and nothing else, and
a datacenter address is served the watch page without its details. The poll
had known each title all along — it is the first thing in every
submission's note — so the pipeline now carries the feed's title and the
meeting's own day (read from the title, then the posting day) into the plan,
and when the poll's key is at hand it asks YouTube's own `videos.list` for
the exact title, the posting day and the tape's length. The four meetings
that landed nameless are repaired the same way.

The hosted pipeline's summaries had been extractive while the constitution
named Gemini: the model seam reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the pipeline only
carried `RECORD_GEMINI_KEY`, the embed stage's. The pipeline now bridges the
key once, in its own process, so the hosted lane is the labeled Gemini
lane the page describes — and the ledger's summaries row says plainly that
a summary pressed before that lane existed names the desk model that
drafted it.

And the reading is drafted (specs/24 §4, Stephen's yes): three short
paragraphs per meeting — what it meant, who moved it, what to watch — with a
timestamp beside every claim, drafted at ingest by the same lane, stored
beside the counted reading with the model's name, never instead of it.
They press into the meeting plane only when a model wrote them; the meeting
page, the front page's latest story and a paper's reading block show them
under their own label with every receipt a link into the tape; the
constitution gains their row in the same commit. The live meetings are
backfilled once, under the spend cap. The seam's default Gemini model had
been retired by the API (`gemini-2.0-flash`); the default is the one the API
names now, and the pipeline job can name another in `CONTROL_Z_LLM_MODEL`.
597 tests.

### The toggle and the scope, composed — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.17)

Live at v2.1.16 the front page's two stories stood stacked for a returning
reader: the toggle hid the other story with `hidden`, and the town scope —
which paints `hidden` on every card that carries a `data-town`, the latest
meeting's story included — painted it back the moment it ran. The toggle
now hides by its own class on the story's make-wrapper, so the scope's
`hidden` and the toggle compose: under a town's scope a story of another
town stays hidden by the scope, the unselected story by the toggle, and
returning to the whole record shows exactly the story the reader chose.
Pane-checked in every combination. 584 tests.

### The front page is the story — the record over time, the latest meeting, the two paths, the mode bar — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.16)

The record's front page led with a picture and a door. It now leads with
two stories the press writes at press time, one showing at a time behind
a two-tab toggle (both stand with the script off). **The record, over
time**: a counted headline and lede — the bodies and towns, the longest
thread, the roll calls passed and failed with the latest quoted, the
busiest month, the lean of the talk, what keeps coming back — then the
record by the numbers, votes over time as dots stacked by meeting, the
six widest issues month by month as small multiples, the eight lenses as
a heat strip meeting by meeting, the recurring topics as bars, the record
in words as a cloud, and what changed. **The latest meeting, what
happened**: the labeled summary as the lede, a counted commentary (how
long the night ran, what the analyzer found, the loudest moment quoted
with its time and kind, the lean of the talk and its drift, the money on
the table, who was named), the meeting in numbers, the shape of the tape
with its moments marked, the moments that decided it, the roll calls,
the framing, the questions by type, the meeting in words, where the
night's topics fell slice by slice, who and what was named, the filings,
the still at card size. Every picture is pressed SVG or HTML in the
paper palette, byte-identical press to press, with a receipt under every
mark and a table twin; every sentence of commentary is a rule over the
planes — no model wrote a line of it, and each story says so beneath its
lede. Each ends where the making half begins: *make this story yours*
opens the same story as a draft, block for block.

The studio learned the two paths as templates — one meeting, what
happened; over time, how it moved — on five new kinds the paper carries
as refs and enums like every kind before them: a numbers chart (a
meeting's or an issue's), the shape of a meeting, an issue's ledger, one
meeting's roll calls, and the record's reading (decisions, questions,
names and pushback for a meeting; the milestones in order for an issue —
extractive, receipts throughout). They travel the link at v=4, the
store, the export and the renderers; the panel's chart menu and the
add-search's hit buttons offer them. A writing desk sits beside every
note: three rotating prompts and a drawer of facts at hand from the
paper's own planes, each cited at the caret as a receipt. And a mode bar
under the section line says plainly whether you are reading or editing —
Read / Edit, a radiogroup like the footprint control, in the studio's own
accents when the studio is open. The two paths section beneath the
stories names the ways in and offers real starts. specs/24 is the paper
trail. 584 tests.

### Nightly intake — the standing rule, and YouTube's own caption list — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.16)

The poll found meetings every night and the pipeline ingested none of them:
`approved` was only ever written by a click, the queue was unattended, and
the poll's caption probe — the watch page, read from a datacenter address —
was served YouTube's bot wall and filed every candidate as "not checked".
The ingest's third caption route, the community caption service (the
highlighter's public transcript engine, fetching through a residential
proxy), was proven from inside Cloud Run today: the whole June 18 tape,
7,842 cues, in under six seconds. The pipeline could always ingest; nothing
ever told it to.

Two things now can, and both are a steward's to switch on. A source may
carry a **standing rule** (`auto_approve`, a checkbox in the console's
intake screen): the poll files a rule-matched candidate at `approved`, but
only when YouTube's own caption list names a track for it; a candidate with
no track yet files for a person and is asked about again on later nights
for a week; the audit log names the rule the way it names a steward; a rule
never touches what a person submits. And the probe asks **YouTube's own
list** when the poll carries a Data API key (`RECORD_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, a
secret): `captions.list` answers with a key alone and names the
auto-generated track that `videos.list`'s `caption` flag hides — a refusal
(quota, a restricted key, a throttle) is never reported as an absence, and
the key never reaches a note or a log. Without a key the probe reads the
watch page as before and a rule approves nothing from the cloud.

`/app/ai` says, in the same commit, that a standing rule may gate the
record beside the promise it qualifies. `record/OPERATING.md` gains the
nightly-intake section and the one-line-per-job rule: the poll and the
pipeline were found on an image two months old. 573 tests.

### specs/23 C + B2, the folds folded — live print twins, true pairs, the reader's last press — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.15)

A focused re-review of v2.1.14's two folds (three lenses; fourteen
findings, twelve distinct) found where the fixes still fought each other
or said less than the truth. Eight of the fourteen reached their skeptics
— fifteen votes, every one standing; the other six were read against the
code by hand and pinned by tests, their skeptics having run into the
account's spend limit (the re-run was stopped at the day's hand-off).
Every finding is folded.

The printed paper prints what the editor shows: the note's and the
title's print twins follow each keystroke and re-read the live fields on
beforeprint, so words typed since the last render print, and a long title
prints whole instead of one clipped line. The editor paints a block at
half width only where the reader's page pairs it — two consecutive
halves, taken two at a time — and only where the reader's page sets
halves side by side; a lone half, and every half on a phone, paints full
width, as the reader sees it and as it prints. The tape's lines land in
the add-search in place, so a hit the reader has tabbed onto, or a
document chooser in flight, survives them, and the status line gives no
verdict while the lines are still being read. A digest whose appearances
are all undated shows them as undated instead of calling them curated
away; a quote on a tape with no lines says the line isn't in this
pressing, not that it was left unfetched; a document chooser whose
meeting didn't load offers a real "try again" that fetches again.

On the reel page, a second cite of the meeting a stashed switch will
load moves that switch — the reader's last press is the one that loads,
or, held, the one that is cued — and a ▶ on the page frame resumes a
paused reel from where the frame stands against its clip: inside it,
from its start, or on to the next clip when the pause landed at its end.
The stage cues a stopped clip at its exact start, so the frame's own ▶
there resumes the clip within its bounds, and a trim reaches the clip a
stop left behind.

The tests now run the real stops. One twin drives the real pagePause and
pvPause through both load gaps with the frames and the reel engine stubbed; another runs
the quote, head and layout renderers; and a mutation pass reverted each
of this fold's seventeen fixes in turn — every revert fails the suite.

A second review followed — three lenses on this fold, two skeptics on
every finding: thirteen findings, none refuted, all folded. The
add-search can no longer be stranded on "searching…" by a query holding
the word "constructor" (the shard lookup read Object.prototype's; both
the editor's and the search page's lookups now read own postings only,
and a lines search that breaks says so instead of "no match"); the
status line says "searching the tape's lines" and the body "or their
lines" only when the lines are searched — three characters or more; the
all-undated digest says what it paints; a document chooser asks once more
before "didn't load" when the paper's own render cached a failure, and
only then; the page frame's ▶ never acts on a swapped-out tape's time
while a switch settles; a load in flight is not a seen silence for either
engine — both forget the old tape's rest and time the moment a load is
sent; a trim reaches the clip a stop left behind and its link follows;
the dead line in the stash branch is gone; paired halves print with a
gutter; an untitled draft prints "Untitled paper" as the reader's page
does. And the tests now run what the tokens only named: the editor's
pair marks at the call site, the print twins and the beforeprint
re-read, the lines guard, the hold a second press releases, the load's
forgetting, the settling beat, the trim of a stopped clip; the print
sheet's assertions are bounded to the print block at both sites that
read to the end of the file.

### specs/23 B2, refolded — one engine, held — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.14)

The preview stage's own re-review (three lenses, eighteen findings, eight
distinct once deduplicated) found the first fold right in shape and loose
at the edges. Both frames are now held silent after the other engine
speaks until they are SEEN silent — a paused or cued report — because a
pause sent before playback begins is a no-op to the player; a play
reported meanwhile with no reader's hand in the frame is an autoplay
landing late, and is paused again. A stop before a frame is ready cues
the tape where the reader asked for it instead of trusting a pause. The
ready work runs once. The reader's own ▶ on the stage frame resumes a
clip, bounded and unarmed, or plays the tape unbounded and says so; a ▶
on the page frame resumes a reel the stage paused. The status line says
what the frame is doing — previewing, paused on the frame, played,
playing the tape with no clip's bounds, stopped — a trim never flips a
played clip back to previewing, and the tray's focus never lands on an
arrow. Two node twins drive the real stage and page dispatchers through
every case, and the pane ran eight scenarios against the real tape; the
worst of them, a page frame already buffering its autoplay when the
stage spoke, went to cued without a sound. This re-review's skeptic pass
never ran (the account's session limit); every finding was read against
the code by hand and folded.

### specs/23 C2 — a pull-quote, a document, a digest, and the paper in print — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.14)

Three more kinds a paper may carry, every one a reference and none of
them words. A **pull-quote** is a transcript line by (pid, t): its words
are read off the pressed tape when the paper renders, never stored, and
the store refuses a quote that tries to carry text. A **document** is one
of a meeting's own filings by its id, resolved from the meeting plane. A
**digest** is "what changed" — an issue and a window of its latest
appearances, computed from the issue's timeline at render, the window
clamped to twelve. Each rides the link in its own grammar (`q.<pid>:<t>`,
`d.<pid>~<doc>`, `g.<slug>:<n>`), lifts the link to v=3 like a layout
does, round-trips, and degrades — a mangled part drops alone. The editor
reaches them where they live: the inline add-search now searches the
tape's own lines through the reader's static search index (the same
planes the search page reads — no new door) and offers to quote one; a
meeting hit offers its documents, one button per filing; an issue hit
offers its digest; a clip on the tray offers to quote its line. And a
rendered paper **prints** as a paper: the nameplate stays, the studio and
the reader's controls go, the title runs the page, a lead and a section
head start a fresh line, two half-width blocks share a row, and every
citation prints its address so the receipts survive on paper. Five review lenses reported thirty-two findings against C1 and C2,
twenty-four once deduplicated. The skeptic pass ran into the account's
session limit after fifteen votes: thirteen stood, and two refuted one
printed-address finding as cosmetic (folded anyway). Every finding was
read against the code by hand and folded, with five more of the author's
own from reading the printed pages back. A quote by (pid, second) is
every line the tape holds at that second; a tape that did not load is
said as such, never as curated away; a digest ranks dated appearances
and counts the undated; a section head paints for every kind and never
drops a note's body; the add-search paints at once and never paints a
stale query; the shelf survives a blocking dialog, and a fresh reader's
visit writes nothing; the printed paper spells every address whole on a
line of its own and drops the studio's sidebar shift. One link version,
v=3, names the whole tier, so C shipped as one deploy, not the two first
planned.

### specs/23 C1 — a shelf of papers, and layouts that travel — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.14)

One browser kept one paper; now it keeps a shelf. `cz-papers` holds every
paper and which one is open; the single P1 draft migrates in exactly once
(kept whole as the first paper, then its key removed — the loadReel way);
the panel offers new / open / delete — a shelf that is never empty, a
delete that asks when there is anything to lose. Every panel, editor and
render still means one thing by "the draft": the open paper, in P1's own
shape. And a block may ask for a **layout** — an enum, never data: lead
(full width, the large treatment), head (its name over a rule), half (two
halves share a row; one column on a phone). It rides the doc, the link
(`l=` as index:layout pairs, so a v1 or v2 `b=` never changes shape, and a
laid-out paper travels as v=3 by `paperV`'s own rule), the export, and the
store (one optional key, strictly one of three values, part of the
canonical bytes; a clip never carries one). The decoder is total: an
unknown layout drops, a mangled `l=` costs a layout never a throw, and a
layout names its block by the link's own part index. The on-page editor
gets a layout control per block; templates lead with their first block.

### specs/23 D2 — the freeze, diagnosed — 2026-09-23

`edition_date` stopped at 2026-06-18 not because the feed died. Verified
in the cloud's own logs: `record-nightly-poll` runs every night and files
submissions (Boston, three a day around the 22nd; Brookline's titles miss
every rule), and `record-nightly-ingest` runs every night and finds *0
approved submissions waiting* — the steward queue is unattended. And the
caption probe, run from inside Cloud Run, is intercepted: for a meeting
this Mac sees captions on, the datacenter address is served a watch page
with neither captions nor video details — YouTube's wall for addresses it
does not trust — so a hosted ingest of a YouTube meeting cannot fetch its
words either. There was no scheduler for the press and the Pages carry
was by hand; D1 wrote the workflow that closes that gap. What remains is
Stephen's: working the queue, and either a YouTube Data API key for the
hosted probe and fetch (spend) or a desk-side step that brings the
captions in.

### specs/23 D1 — the source points home, releases are tagged, CI runs the suite, the nightly edition — 2026-09-23 (live since v2.1.13)

The constitution's "check it yourself" and the covenant's source line
point at this repository now — the record's home since the extraction —
and `LICENSING.md` with them. OPERATING §5 gains the release step the
deploy loop already practised: push and tag `vX.Y.Z` at the exact commit
the container was built from, named for its image. A minimal GitHub
Actions workflow runs the no-Postgres suite on every push and pull
request, with node present so the JS twins execute. And the freeze's
missing step is written: a nightly workflow that presses from the cloud
after the ingest, carries the edition into the Pages repo and pushes only
when it changed — standing down, saying so, until Stephen provisions the
three credentials it needs (OPERATING §5 names them).

### specs/22 P2 — the preview stage: hearing a clip before keeping it — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.13)

The one dangerous item in the cutting room, built as its own bounded
machine with its laws written before its code (specs/23 B2). The stage
hears only messages from its own frame and the page player only from its
own — `onYT` gates on `YT.win` now, a strictly narrower singleton; one
engine seeks — starting the stage pauses the page player and any reel it
was playing, and every door into the page player (`loadTape`, `ytSeek`,
`startReel`) pauses the stage; the stage has its own armed gate and settle
window, reproduced for one clip, and plays exactly that clip, then stops;
a stage nobody can see is silent — leaving the studio or collapsing the
rail pauses it. It lives in the studio markup outside every node the panel
repaints, built on the first ▶ (that press is the click-to-load). The
panel tray's ▶ previews here; ↗ still opens the tape in a new tab. A
paper's reel rows inherit it: a ▶ beside each cite, a sibling never a
nested control, painted only in the studio and in the paper's own deep
green. `pvStep` is twin-tested; every law is pinned by token. Five review lenses raised 33 findings against the stage as first
committed; every one is folded, and the deploy carries the fold. The
skeptic pass ran into the account's session limit after 18 of its votes —
each of those stood, or found the fold already in place — and the fold's
own adversarial re-review follows; anything it finds ships with the next
version.

### specs/22 — the cutting room: reels, cut from anywhere — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.12)

The record was readable everywhere and cuttable in exactly one place: the
moment cards of a meeting page. Now every timed unit the record shows is
a clip waiting to happen, the tray follows you, and a shared reel opens
back up into yours (specs/22, the five settlements of 2026-07-22, all
five built to the letter; specs/23 phase B).

**Cut from anywhere.** Every transcript row grows a quiet tick (hidden
until the row is hovered or focused — a big tape is thousands of rows —
but always in the accessibility tree, and a pressed tick stays): the clip
is the row's own segment, start to the next row's start, its words as the
quote. Every search hit gets one, beside the row (a sibling in a wrapper,
never a control inside a link); every issue bead gets one after the bead.
Clip identity stays `(pid, kind, t)`; the link grammar never carried kind
and does not change. The composer stands on every meeting page now,
moments or none — the rows are cuttable, so a page with zero scored
moments still cuts.

**The panel is the tray — everywhere.** The studio panel's reel block
grew from a count into the real thing: the clip list with per-clip trim
(in/out, snapped to the record's own lines), reorder, remove, and a ▶
preview that opens the tape in a new tab (the settled answer — the
`/app/r` player-singleton is not touched). The meeting-page tray and the
panel tray are one engine (`trayAct`) painting one key (`writeTray`);
trims may await a bounds fetch, and the reel is re-read and the clip
re-found by identity after the await, so a press that landed meanwhile is
never overwritten. **Cross-page trims are honest now**: the tray fetches
the clip's meeting `transcript.txt` (already pressed; one fetch per
meeting, parsed `[H:MM:SS]` starts, cached) and snaps anywhere; where the
fetch fails the two-second nudge remains and the tray says so, once.

**The remix loop.** `/app/r` offers **make this reel yours**: into an
empty tray the clips simply arrive; into a tray with clips the choice is
explicit and painted — append after what you have (clips already held,
by identity, are not doubled), replace it behind a confirm, or keep
yours — never silently either. The panel tray offers **file into your
paper** (a snapshot; the tray keeps rolling), the cite sheet, and
`reel.json` for a single-meeting reel, wherever the panel stands.

The uncommitted ~531-line partial in control-z's working tree was the
basis of the P0 half — read hunk by hunk, applied here, and owned:
adapted to phase A's editor and panel, guarded (the byte-clean sweep now
covers `seg-tick`, `btick`, `stick`, `data-czcut`, the panel tray and the
viewer's chooser; the reel-path scan now checks the one raw fetch stays
on the edition), twin-tested (`parseSegTimes`, `stepEdge`, the segment
tick's bounds, the mid-fetch race, `takeMerge`). A five-lens adversarial
pass confirmed fifteen findings, every one folded: a transcript tick press
bubbled into the seek handler and started the tape; a taken reel collapsed
distinct cuts into one identity; anywhere-cuts were relabelled as the
nearest scored moment on `/app/r`, in papers and when taken (cuts now
quote their own line off the tape); the new tray engine no-op'd in a
storage-blocked browser (it reads the composer's copy there); a meeting-
tray press moved focus into the panel; hit and bead clips carried no
tape, date or length and could end past the tape; bead ticks painted as
full-width bars; the ticks covered the words they cut and were blind
targets on touch; cross-page trims snapped at the wrong grain; a failed
transcript fetch was remembered as no bounds; the tick glyphs rode into
citations; label-in-name; a two-hour tape was thousands of new tab stops
(the ticks left the tab order; `c` on a row's time link cuts it); the
last clip's ✕ and the `/app/r` chooser dropped focus to the body;
`decodeReel` threw on a bad escape. The fold's own re-read caught one
more: a second press on a hit's tick during its plane fetch would have
doubled the clip. 548 tests.

### specs/23 A — the open newsroom: the front door + the real editor — 2026-09-23 (v2.1.11)

The diagnosis, verified live on v2.1.10: nothing was broken — the making
half was invisible. One corner pill and one quiet sentence carried the
product's entire second half, and the owner could not find the way to
edit a front page. Phase A makes the making half a place a stranger can
find and use, without touching a byte of paper mode.

**The front door** — a real front-page section, baked as the record's
own prose in the paper palette (`yp-`, a new namespace): a kicker in the
"your paper — be the editor" register, two sentences of benefit copy, a
primary **Start your paper** that opens the editor at `/app/p#edit`,
three template starts the editor reads from the hash (`#edit&tpl=rolls`,
`tpl=meeting&ref=<pid>`, `tpl=issue&ref=<slug>` — the same shapes the
featured papers press, offered as DRAFTS), and the featured papers grown
from one `.featline` into cards. It sits after the lead row, so home
stays the record's front page. Real links throughout: with JavaScript
off they land on the stub's honest hint.

**"＋ your paper" on the record's cards** — every meeting and issue card
the front page presses (the lead, the briefs, the long view, the
updates) and every meeting on an issue's timeline grows a small
affordance in preview and studio modes: press it and the story joins
your paper without leaving the page; press again and it leaves. The
label is the painted truth ("✓ in your paper"). A card is a whole-card
link, so the button is a SIBLING in a wrapper row (never a control
inside a control) — the scope filter hides the row with the card.
Script-added, never baked (the byte-clean guard now sweeps `cz-mk`,
`cz-ed` and `cz-drop`), and never painted in paper mode (the JS removes
it; the sheet hides it as a belt). `addPageToPaper` generalised to
`addStoryRef(ref, at)`.

**The on-page editor** — `/app/p` in the studio renders YOUR DRAFT as an
editor on the paper itself, not only in the sidebar: a drag handle per
block (HTML5 drag-and-drop, armed only while the handle is held so a
note's text still selects), ↑ ↓ ✕ per block (the panel's own controls,
mirrored, so no arrangement is pointer-only; the handle also takes ↑ ↓),
the title typed in place, notes typed in place, and an insertion point
between any two blocks that opens an inline add: a lexical search over
the record's own static index — `search/meta.json` names every meeting
and a new `issues/index.json` (written inside `bake_issues`, so the
hosted press mirrors it free) names every issue — plus a note, the reel
and the record-wide charts. Adds land at the chosen index
(`insertBlock`); a drop lands at its slot (`moveBlock`, twin-tested);
focus survives every repaint and never falls to a ✕. A shared or stored
paper never grows any of this — read-only until specs/22's
make-this-yours. On a phone the collapsed studio rail now shifts the
page by its own 44px instead of covering every line's left edge.

**First run** — the empty draft in the studio teaches: the title, three
big starts (the templates, with refs from `stats.json`; browse the
record) and the first insertion point. The pill says the thing itself:
**✎ Your paper — edit**.

The covenant held throughout: composing is still client-only, the
add-search reads static planes, the door count is unchanged, free text
stored is still title + notes. A five-lens adversarial pass confirmed
23 findings (the first landing on `/app/p#edit` double-rendered and
dropped focus; on a phone the door opened the drawer over the editor it
promised; the hash door re-opened the studio on every reload; a same-
document `#edit` click was inert; a block dropped on the title typed its
index into the field; the editor's `dragstart` guard cancelled the
reader's own drags in the read-only render; an open add-search died on
any repaint; the hit list was a live region; a dark index read as an
empty record; label-in-name on the toggles; the lede link with no
underline; the placeholder at the browser default; the covenant scan
stopping short of the editor) — every one folded. The fold's own re-
review (by hand, the workflow's finders having hit a session limit)
caught three more: a repaint could paint a stale title over a caret, a
dark index could never actually retry (`getJSON` keeps a failed fetch),
and the lead kicker's clearance leaked into paper mode on a 320px phone.
542 tests.

### specs/21 P3 — templates, the featured papers, and the radiogroup — 2026-07-22 (v2.1.10) · the spec is DONE

The studio's last owed phase, and the smallest: three ways in, no new
server surface, no new store surface.

**Templates** — pre-shaped papers the editor starts from, offered only
while the draft is wholly empty: *the roll calls, watched* anywhere;
*this issue, watched* on an issue's page; *this meeting, covered* on a
meeting's. A template writes the same blocks the panel's own buttons
would — and its note joins **empty**, because the editor's words are
nobody's to pre-write. It re-checks the draft at the click and asks
before replacing anything another tab may have typed.

**Featured papers** — the front door: up to three example papers built
**at press time** from the record's own top issues and votes (the roll
calls with the record's framing; the loudest issue with its reach; the
latest meeting with its framing and the recurring topics), pressed as
ordinary `/app/p` links by a Python twin of the JS codec and **pinned to
it byte-for-byte by a node parity test** (decode in node, re-encode,
identical — and v= must equal `paperV`'s own judgement, so every featured
link travels v=2 the moment it carries a chart). They render in the
`/app/p` stub's empty state OUTSIDE `#paperbody` (the renderer owns that
node), stand as plain links with JavaScript off, retire the moment any
real paper renders, and return when the draft empties. The front page
says it once, quietly: *papers, pressed from the record*.

**The radiogroup** — the mode control stops pretending to be three
toggles: `role=radiogroup`, `role=radio` + `aria-checked`, a roving
tabindex so the control costs a keyboard exactly one stop, and arrow keys
(Home/End too) that move the choice; modified chords stay the browser's.

Two review passes folded 12 + 3 findings. The review's HIGH was the
selector the migration orphaned — `.cz-mode[aria-pressed="true"]` styled
a state the JS no longer writes, so every mode radio painted identical;
the pair (attribute written, selector styled) is now pinned by a test.
The re-review then caught the fix stopping one reader short: `toggleRail`
still consulted storage while its neighbours had learned the painted
truth — and the honest fix reads BOTH axes off the painted classes,
because a storage-blocked browser deriving the next rail state from
storage would collapse once and never expand. Also folded: the featured
cards' focus ring (a bare `var(--focus-ring)` resolves to `outline:none`
— the sheet's own documented trap), underlined featline links (ink vs
slate prose is 2.36:1, under G183's 3:1 for color-alone), and `n_of()` —
every counted noun the bake prints now survives n=1 ("1 meeting", not
"1 meetings", on the front rail, the issue page, its description, and
the graph's tooltips).

903 tests. **specs/21 is done** — P0 (the footprint) → P1 (your paper +
the store) → P2 (charts + notes) → P3 (the front door and the polish).
The next room is specs/22, the cutting room
(`specs/22-cutting-room.md`, drafted and awaiting Stephen's settlement).

### specs/21 P2 — data viz + analyses: charts and notes join your paper — 2026-07-22 (v2.1.9)

A paper can now carry pictures and its editor's own words. **Four chart
kinds** — votes over time (every roll call the record holds: a filled dot
passes, a hollow dot fails, a half-tone square is any other outcome the
record wrote — tabled, tied — with the exact word on the tooltip and the
table; every dot opens the tape where the vote was taken), an issue's reach
(its appearances, meeting by meeting), the framing lenses (one meeting, or
the whole record), and recurring topics — all computed **in the reader's
browser from the record's own pressed planes**, so a paper cannot assert a
number the record would not draw. A chart block is an enum and a ref, never
data. Every chart keeps the rules the baked charts keep: a table twin, a
receipt under every mark (exposed to assistive tech — role="group", never
role="img"), and the paper palette, where deep green is measurement and no
studio hue exists. A new pressed plane carries the roll calls:
**votes.json** — the meeting pages' own votes restated date-ordered, one
fetch at any corpus size (officials.json is per-member and deliberately
different).

**Notes** are the editor's words — the settled posture (checkpointed
2026-07-22): plain text, 2,000 characters, newlines only, no markdown; the
client cleans (total), the store refuses (strict, 422 — and its cap counts
the reader's own UTF-16 units, so a stored note never renders shorter than
it was stored). The rendered block is labeled **"the editor's note"** out
loud, because a reader must never mistake an editor's words for the
record's. Notes travel all three covenant ways — draft, link
(twice-encoded, so their own commas survive the query-string split), and
paper.json — plus the share store, as the second and last free text a
stored paper may carry. Papers carrying P2 kinds travel as **v=2**, so a
reader still on the shipped v1 shell gets its honest "shared from a newer
version" message instead of a silently mutilated paper; a stories+reels
paper still encodes byte-for-byte as P1 did.

The studio panel grows **＋ a note** (a field under its row, saving on
every keystroke without stealing the caret) and **＋ a chart** (a quiet
menu offering what the open page can chart plus the record-wide three).
`cut()` keeps every free-text cap surrogate-safe — a bare slice could
strand half an emoji and make the encoders throw (a latent P1 crash on the
title cap, fixed at all four sites, lone surrogates dropped anywhere they
hide).

Two adversarial review passes: 16 confirmed findings folded (the outcome
binarization, the AT-invisible receipts, the v=2 gate, the store's honest
"too large" sentence surfaced instead of "didn't answer", the caret capture
that had read activeElement after the innerHTML wipe since P1, the twin
tables' scroll container, the UTF-16 cap), then the focused re-review of
the fixes caught its one HIGH — the share row's new truth had no repaint
trigger on the note-emptiness boundary — and that folded too.

### "Our AI Constitution" + the shareable link — 2026-07-21 (v2.1.8)

The constitution takes its proper name — **Our AI Constitution** — in the
page, the footer, and both buttons. And it gets a direct link made to be
shared: **publicrecord.studio/constitution** (a root-level redirect in the
Pages repo, listed in OPERATING §5) with a pressed twin at
`/app/constitution`; `/app/ai` stays canonical, and the page now states its
own shareable address.

### The AI constitution + the footer recredit — 2026-07-21

publicrecord grows its disclosure surface: **/app/ai — the AI constitution**.
Eight articles (values as checkable promises, each with a "check it yourself"
receipt), a pipeline diagram of where the models sit, and **the ledger** —
when a model touches the record, whose model it is
(`gemini-embedding-001` for meaning search; the labeled Gemini lane for
summaries and issue names; a Whisper-family model on our own hardware only
when a tape has no captions), where it runs, and what stands without it —
including the rows where there is **no model at all** (moments, reels, kits,
papers, the front page) and the desk's **local-only** models
(civicmedia.studio / Control-Z: your machine, offline, nothing leaves the
room). Prominently part of the Community AI Project (the toolmaking argument,
at the record's volume), with resources for going deeper. Native
interactivity (details/summary, an aria-labeled diagram with the ledger as
its table twin) — complete with JavaScript off, quiet palette throughout,
precached for offline reading.

The footer on every page is recredited: *an open source project from
weird machine and brookline interactive group. this project uses AI in
accordance with our AI constitution.* The covenant (about) page and the town
scope (settings) block both carry the button.

### specs/21 P1 — your paper: the curated document + the share store — 2026-07-21

The studio's making surface arrives. A reader curates their **own paper** — a
document of blocks: stories (a meeting, an issue) and reels — titles it,
arranges it, and shares it. The paper lives the way a reel lives: in this
browser (the draft), in its link (the whole paper, URL-encoded), and in a
`paper.json` file; a **content-addressed share store** adds an optional short
link. Edition **v2.1.7**, image **r29**.

- **The document model** (`publicrecord.paper/1`) — client-side, one
  localStorage draft (`cz-paper`). Blocks are refs into the record; the draft
  carries ride-along display meta, but every traveling form strips to refs, so
  a paper can never assert a title the record's planes would not.
- **The panel becomes the editor** — the studio sidebar's "your paper" section
  grows a title field, the block list with ↑ ↓ ✕ arrange controls, context
  adds ("＋ this meeting" / "＋ this issue" on their pages, "＋ your reel" when
  the tray holds clips — a snapshot, so the tray keeps rolling), and the share
  row (open / copy link / paper.json / short link / clear). Ticking a moment
  updates the reel count *and* the paper panel live.
- **`/app/p` — one static stub for every paper** (the `/app/r` pattern; an
  `emit_stubs` change shared by bake and press). The renderer decodes
  whichever arrived — `?p=<id>` (the store) → the link form (`?v=1&t=…&b=…`) →
  the browser's draft — enriches every block from the record's own planes, and
  renders in the **paper palette**: whatever mode the editor liked, a rendered
  paper carries zero studio hue (computed-style-verified). Stories whose
  meeting or issue left the pressing say so in place; reel blocks cite like
  `/app/r` and play there. JS-off, the stub says honestly what it needs.
- **Every decoder keeps decodeReel's law** — malformed input degrades to fewer
  blocks, never a throw; a query that decodes to *nothing* says "this link
  doesn't carry a readable paper" rather than mislabeling the reader's own
  draft. Node twins pin the round-trip, the caps, the hostile-input table.
- **The share store (§6.2, Stephen-approved)** — `POST /api/papers` on
  record-api validates strictly (the only free text is the title, 200 chars,
  control-char-free; everything else exact-shaped refs), canonicalizes
  server-side (times snapped to the tenth-second grid, whole seconds
  collapsed), and writes once to a private bucket at the SHA-256 of the
  paper's own bytes — idempotent, read-only on GET, immutable-cacheable, no
  identity anywhere. No list endpoint, no delete API (takedown is a steward's
  hand, OPERATING §6). Unset bucket → honest 503; the client fails soft to
  the full link. The store is additive, never load-bearing: servers vanish,
  every paper still reads and travels.
- Tests: 16 store-contract tests (canonical form, refusals, idempotence,
  endpoints), 7 paper node-twin tests, the pressed-stub test; the reader's
  API-door guard now names the sanctioned set (search + the store's two
  touches, each timed and caught).

### specs/21 P0 — the studio: be the editor of your own paper (the footprint shell) — 2026-07-20

The record shipped as a reader; specs/21 lets that reader become an editor. This
is the shell — three modes the reader controls, and the make-loop that exists
surfaced inside them. Built entirely by `app.js`, so the pressed pages stay
byte-for-byte the specs/20 paper (a guard test proves no studio class is ever
baked).

- **Three modes, one footprint** — a control kept in `localStorage`
  (`cz-studio-mode`, default **preview**), never a server:
  - **preview** — a compact, non-blocking pill in the corner: an invitation to
    edit, the reel count, and a way to dismiss to paper. Quiet (neutrals + deep
    green); the resident's page stays fully clickable, on the phone and the
    desktop both.
  - **studio** — the full left sidebar, and the one place publicrecord's volume
    goes *up* (the ratified palette lift, §6.1). The paper shifts to become the
    canvas beside it; a collapse handle rails the sidebar (`cz-studio-rail`).
  - **paper** — the studio recedes to a single tab; just the quiet specs/20
    reader, never louder, because it *is* specs/20.
- **The make-loop, surfaced not rebuilt** — the studio reads the same global
  `cz-reel` tray the meeting composer fills and shows it live (a count on the
  preview pill, a play/share/clear panel in studio), updating as you tick
  moments across meetings, in this tab and across tabs.
- **The palette amendment (§6.1), bounded and AA** — studio mode borrows
  civicmedia's purple (`#a855f7`, borders/surfaces) with a darker violet
  (`#7c3aed`) for text and text-on-purple so every studio control clears WCAG AA
  4.5:1; bright green (`#22c55e`) as a non-text reel accent. All declared under
  `html.cz-m-studio` only — they cannot reach the paper, the preview, or the
  shared masthead. **Zero fuchsia.** The pressed-CSS guard admits the purples
  *only* in a studio-scoped rule.
- **Degrades to paper** — JavaScript off, and the reader gets the paper (the
  studio is script-built). Narrow mobile never shifts the reading — the studio
  becomes an overlay drawer, preview stays the same small pill. Flat vector (no
  drop shadows), reduced-motion safe, keyboard-focus managed across mode
  switches, tab order matches the visual order.
- **Covenant-clean** — no account, no cookie, no server on the studio path; the
  mode and the reel live in `localStorage` and the link. Pinned by node twins
  (`readMode` validation, the make-path-touches-no-server proof) and a
  paper-is-byte-clean guard.

Resolved with Stephen (2026-07-20): the three-mode shape, the bounded studio
palette lift, the naming ("your paper" / "the editor" / "edit"), and — for P1 —
a content-addressed shared-paper store as the default share, with the link + an
exportable `paper.json` as the covenant substrate. See `specs/21-web-studio.md`
§6. Two adversarial-review passes (5-lens + a focused re-review of the fixes),
every confirmed finding folded in. **855 green.**

### specs/20 P2 finished — cross-meeting reels + per-issue RSS; dark mode declined — 2026-07-20

The last of P2 (§7.9), after the kit plane.

- **P2-B — reels span meetings.** A reel was one meeting's moments strung
  together; now it can hold the turns of an argument as they cross meetings and
  years, still client-only and still living entirely in its link. One meeting is
  the exact **v1** link every existing share and kit page already carries; two or
  more becomes **v2** (`?v=2&c=<pid>:<start>-<end>,…`, each clip prefixed with its
  meeting). The composer is now one global tray you build across meetings (tick
  on one, navigate, tick on another — it carries and labels each clip's meeting);
  the `/app/r` viewer fetches every meeting the reel touches, enriches each clip
  from its own moments, and plays clip to clip, loading the next meeting's tape
  with `loadVideoById` when the reel crosses. The cite sheet groups by meeting;
  reel.json stays single-meeting (the desk render is — cross-meeting rendering is
  a desk step still to come, and the page says so). v1↔v2 round-trip, the
  (meeting, kind, time) clip identity, and the tape-switch are pinned by tests
  run in node. Verified live: a reel of two Brookline meetings, authored in the
  tray (v1→v2 as it crossed) and played back "4 moments across 2 meetings."

- **P2-C — per-issue RSS in the chrome.** The long-view feed per issue has
  shipped since R1; now each issue page advertises its own feed in the head
  (`<link rel="alternate">`, before the firehose), and every feed item carries a
  `<pubDate>` (a corpus date → RFC-822 midnight UTC, deterministic, no
  wall-clock) so a reader's client sorts by date.

- **Dark mode — declined for the reader (open Q3).** publicrecord is "ink on
  white," and that is the brand pillar the paper keeps; the dark/IDE look stays
  civicmedia / Control-Z's. Resolved as "never for the reader" — revisitable.

### specs/20 P2 — Publisher's reading half: the record presses a kit per meeting — 2026-07-20

The newspaper (P0) and the reel composer (P1) already moved the *reading* halves
of Memory and Highlighter into the browser. This does the same for **Publisher**:
`/app/k` — a publish kit for every meeting that has a tape to cut from.

A kit is the clips worth cutting plus draft copy to ship them with — titles, a
description with chapters, alt text — and every input it needs was already
pressed (the `moments` plane, the meeting's entities, its summary). So the
record assembles the kit deterministically, with no model (the press is the one
pipeline stage that calls no AI), and pages it read-only. The one desk-bound
step — rendering the clips as video — stays at the desk, and the page says so;
the emitted `kit.json` is a real Publisher kit a producer downloads and opens
there to carry on from the draft.

- **The shared writer** (`czcore/kit.py`, new). The pure copy-assembly logic
  moved out of `publisher/kit.py` into the shared core both the desk and the
  record import, so one artifact has one writer and the two can't drift.
  `publisher.kit` imports it back under its old names — the surface is unchanged.
- **The kit plane** (`web/kit.py`, `web/bake.py`, `record/press.py`).
  `kit_from_meeting` derives a kit from a pressed meeting; `bake_kits` writes
  `kits/<pid>.json` + `kits/index.json`. The stage is mirrored into the hosted
  press, and a new parity test holds the two orchestrations equal.
- **The reader** (`web/emit.py`, `web/static/app.web.css`). `/app/k` index +
  a page per kit; the clips deep-link the tape and "play as a reel" hands off to
  the `/app/r` viewer. Publisher's line on `/app/press` flips from "nothing yet"
  to the kits — but only in an edition that pressed some, so the door stays
  honest. Quiet palette, JS-off readable, verified at desktop + 375px.
- **Guards**. A cross-process idempotence test (two presses under different
  `PYTHONHASHSEED` must be byte-identical — the determinism the deploy needs);
  the container's cold-start import check now names `web.bake`/`web.emit`/
  `web.kit` so a bad import fails the build, not the 3am press.

Reviewed by a five-lens adversarial panel (covenant, idempotence, desk-compat,
refactor blast radius, brand + a11y); every finding folded in. 847 tests green.

### The moment labels earn their kicker: a word-boundary fix + a higher bar for the paper — 2026-07-20

A moment is only as good as its kind. The shared analyzer matched its keyword
classes as bare substrings, so the moments plane read a celebration as a
`DECISION` — "thank you for joining us … staff who have **devoted** three
decades" (`voted` inside devoted) — and `emotion` / `commotion` as motions,
`coffee` as a fee, `immigrant` as a grant. And `TENSION` fired on any bare
"concern" or "problem": "solve problems", "my question **concerns** equity"
(the verb, not the worry), "there aren't crises" (a negation).

- **The shared fix** (`czcore/moments.py`). `hits_in()` matches word-like
  keywords on a *leading* word boundary — the convention `insight.FRAMING_LENSES`
  already uses. "vote" still reaches votes / voted / voting and "unanimous"
  reaches unanimously, but none reach de**voted** / e**motion** / com**motion**;
  symbolic keywords (`$`, `[applause]`) keep literal substring matching. A
  leading boundary is strictly narrower than a substring, so no genuine motion
  is lost — a correctness fix inherited by `score_segments` and
  `insight.decisions` / `disagreements` / `dynamics`, so Highlighter, Publisher,
  and Memory all get it. An adversarial audit of every consumer found it
  net-positive; two prefixed civic terms worth keeping got their own keywords
  (`disapprove` / `disapproval`; `unfunded` / `underfunded`).

- **The paper's higher bar** (`web/bake.py`, newspaper-only). Stored decisions
  are re-validated on the boundary (so the corpus's baked-in substring FPs drop
  without a re-ingest) and gated for narration — a death ("passed away"), a
  described process ("submitted … approved by", "sent … for approval"). Soft
  tension words (concern / problem) have to be *owned* — a felt worry ("I'm
  concerned about…"), an act of raising it ("express the concern"), an
  intensifier — while a strong word (oppose / crisis / frustrated) still
  carries alone; the gate reads the *windowed sentence*, because the ASR splits
  "but I'm a little / concerned that…" across segments. Pure roll-call mechanics
  ("want to vote?") stay procedure. Highlighter keeps its fuller recall.

- **Verified.** Reproduced from the 10 real Brookline transcripts (63.9h):
  ~70 keyword false positives drop and the same number of real questions and
  decisions rise into the ranked cap. An independent judge panel (one per
  meeting) graded every removed and added label, and a blast-radius panel
  audited each shared consumer; their findings drove the narration gate and the
  keyword restorations. 832 tests green. **Not deployed — pending Stephen's
  review of the before/after, since it changes every meeting page.**

### The reel composer: specs/20 P1 moves Highlighter's composing half into the browser — 2026-07-20

The rule that governed P0 governs this: reading and composing live in the web;
only rendering media stays at the desk, and the page says so. Highlighter cuts
a reel at the desk — this is the *composing* half, in a browser, over the
`moments` plane P0 already presses. No accounts, no server, no new `/api/`: the
reel lives in the URL and this browser's localStorage, nowhere else.

- **The composer** (§20.6, P1a). Every Moments card gains a tick into a reel
  tray: reorder, trim each clip to the transcript's own segment bounds, a live
  total runtime. Three outputs, in order of covenant-cleanliness — a **share
  link** (the reel state URL-encoded and versioned, `/app/r?v=1&m=<pid>&c=<t>-<end>,…`,
  no server); a **cite sheet** (quote · speaker · body · date · deep link per
  clip, one copy, the shape `copyCite` writes extended to a sequence); and a
  **`reel.json`** the desk Highlighter opens to render — the one desk-bound
  step, stated: *"rendering the video needs the desk."* Its clips map straight
  onto `highlighter/reel.py`'s `render_reel`. The model is per-meeting but
  shaped so a second meeting's moments slot in (cross-meeting reels stay R3).

- **The viewer** (§20.6/§20.7, P1b). A shared link opens **`/app/r`** — one
  static stub for every reel — and app.js decodes its state, fetches the
  meeting's own plane, and plays the sequence through the existing
  youtube-nocookie facade, seeking clip to clip (on `currentTime ≥ clip.end` →
  the next clip's start; the seek engine's `armed` gate keeps a stale time
  report from skipping a clip when the reel order runs backward through the
  tape). It shows the current clip's quote and the reel as a deep-linked cite
  list. JS-off, the stub is honest that decoding and playing a reel need
  JavaScript, and sends the reader to the record.

- **Tests.** The share-link encode/decode round-trip, the cite sheet, the
  `reel.json` shape, the clip-to-clip seek engine (including the out-of-order
  guard) — all executed in node against the lifted reader code — plus the
  `/app/r` stub and its JS-off cite fallback, and the covenant (no server on the
  reel path). 822 green.

- **Hardened before ship** (an adversarial review pass over the diff, findings
  verified in node). A clip's identity is now `(kind, time)` — matching the
  bake's own moment dedup key — so the vote and the tension a contested roll
  call emits at the same second no longer collide (ticking one had silently
  toggled the other). The seek engine arms only on a report *inside* the clip
  and before its end, so two stale time reports during a backward seek can't
  arm-then-skip a short clip. And two AA gates: the tray's functional labels
  move off `--text-muted` (2.4:1) to `--text-secondary` (7.2:1), and the moment
  tick clears the 24px minimum target size.

- **Moments are thoughts now, not fragments** (§20.6 follow-up, edition v2.1.1).
  A moment was anchored to a single 2–3s ASR segment, so the reel cut off
  mid-sentence and the plane surfaced procedure ("right, Betsy?", "How we
  doing?"). `_build_moments` now windows each moment out to the whole sentence
  around its anchor with a lead-in/lead-out (6–40s, bounded), quotes that full
  sentence, and gates procedural/short/vocative questions out. The moment gains
  a `start` (the padded clip open) beside its `t` (the anchor); the reel plays
  `[start, end]`, the panel still seeks `t`. On the real Brookline meeting this
  turned 20 mostly-trivial 2s clips into 15 substantive ~17s ones.

- **Tidy.** The coverage-strip label for an undated meeting read `ed`
  (`"undated"[5:]`); it now reads a dash. Shows only after a re-press.

### The record gets its own face: specs/20 P0 ships the newspaper — 2026-07-19

publicrecord.studio was live wearing the desk's clothes — cream paper, oxblood
accents, and a sidebar of thirteen locked tool doors given equal billing with
the record's own surfaces, several showing a demo image the container never
carried. The brand architecture had since settled: civicmedia is the press;
publicrecord is the newspaper. This is the paper. All of specs/20 P0, pressed
from the cloud and served at publicrecord.studio, image `record/api:r21`.

- **The coat** (§20.1). The edition stops borrowing `suite/`'s tokens and takes
  its own, composed byte-faithfully from `brand/` (the single source now, for
  this product) — neutrals and deep green only; no cream, oxblood, amber,
  fuchsia or purple survives the press, and a test proves it. Real Inter and
  JetBrains Mono, subset-latin woff2 self-hosted under `web/static/fonts/` with
  their OFL texts (~157 KB, the only new bytes; CSP gains `font-src 'self'`).
  A nameplate masthead — the publicrecord keycap read byte-equal from
  `brand/logos`, the mono lockup, the classic double rule — over a folio and
  the paper's own section line. The thirteen doors leave the masthead.

- **The front page** (§20.2). A lead story (the latest meeting: a big
  `i.ytimg` still, a mono headline, a deck, its two strongest moments as
  pull-links into the tape), a briefs column, by-the-numbers (every figure a
  link), the long view, what-changed, an access ledger that says its zeros out
  loud, and a roll-calls teaser. Column rules, not boxes; reads linearly with
  JS off.

- **The moments plane** (§6). `web/bake.py` presses, per meeting, the analyzer's
  scored moments as one ranked list — VOTE, DECISION, TENSION, QUESTION, each
  {t, end, kind, score, reason, quote}, scored by `czcore.moments.score_segments`
  — a pure function of the transcript, so the edition stays byte-idempotent.

- **The meeting page** (§20.3). The Moments panel renders those cards, JS-off,
  each seeking the tape. A right-margin minimap (a mark per moment, a line at
  the playhead) and a sticky mini-header arrive as pure enhancement.

- **Search** (§20.4). Instant (debounced, never under three chars), hover peeks
  (±1 segment from the segs plane already in hand — no extra request), and
  keyboard paths (j/k/Enter, `/` to focus). The R1.6 live-first/static-always
  machine is untouched; its degradation proofs still run the real code.

- **The press page + the quiet doors** (§20.5). `/app/press` is one honest page
  about Civic Media Studio — the tool list, the DMG, the cross-link to
  communityai.studio. The thirteen `/app/t/<tool>/` URLs survive as CSP-safe
  redirect stubs into `/app/press#<tool>`; the broken slide images leave the
  domain structurally (a test proves no pressed file references `site/`).

- **Tombstones** (§20.6, closing R1.7's debt). A steward-forgotten issue's URL
  renders *"removed from the record by a steward on {date}"* — the date read
  from the audit ledger (stored state, never a wall clock), so it presses
  idempotently. `PgCorpus.list_forgotten` reads the audit table; the desk store
  returns nothing, because it keeps no such ledger.

The covenant holds throughout: readers are uncounted, every page reads with the
API dark, the bake is byte-idempotent, and the edition stays under its budgets
(fonts are the only new bytes; thumbnails are remote). 816 tests green.

### The record breathes: R1 closes the switches between deployed and alive — 2026-07-19

The wave-1 backend was proven and inert. This is the run that turned it on, and
almost everything it fixed was found by running it against the live channels
rather than by reading — which is the whole argument for walking one meeting end
to end before turning a nightly poll loose.

- **Hosted ingest carries meetings now** (specs/19 R1.4). `record/pipeline.py`
  drains the approved queue: a steward's yes → captions-first ingest → embed →
  issue-assign, calling the same `memory/ingest` the desk calls because it is
  store-agnostic and the parity suite proves it. The first real meeting —
  Boston City Council, July 8 — is on the record: 8,040 segments, through the
  queue with a human in the middle; a second followed, a Brookline Select Board
  meeting the steward approved himself through the console. Three bugs only a
  real meeting could show:
  the meeting shell has to exist before `ingest.run` writes segments (Postgres
  enforces a foreign key SQLite did not); the embed stage scopes to the one new
  meeting or a nightly job embeds the whole town and times out; and the link is
  written before the embed, so a meeting is never live-and-unlinked.

- **Search reads the record two ways at once** (specs/19 R1.6). The reader asks
  the Studio first and falls back to its own prebuilt index the instant the
  Studio does not answer — one timed attempt, no retry, and the page stops
  promising meaning-search the moment it cannot deliver it. Provenance rides
  every live hit: *word*, *meaning*, *both*, *related*. The wiring that makes
  this possible is three-sided — the edition names the API it may call, the API
  names the readers that may call it (CORS, an allowlist, no credentials ever),
  and both go quiet for a desk edition, which stays byte-identical.

- **The neural half is on** (specs/19 R1.2). The whole record embeds as a Cloud
  Run job under a hard spend cap that stops before a batch is bought; the ledger
  proves the $0.66 estimate. Before it ran, a neural query answered `lexical`
  with the honest line "this corpus has not been embedded yet" — the degradation
  verified before the thing it degrades to was switched on.

- **Intake is default-deny again** (found by running it). The first hosted poll
  filed all 45 entries from three channels, PSAs and ribbon cuttings included,
  because the connector had never called the intake rules — the console's
  preview was their only caller. Now the poll files what the preview promised:
  45 polled, 21 filed, the rest excluded or unmatched.

- **Meaning-search stopped scanning the whole table.** At the reader's page size
  a neural query took 45 seconds because the join blocked the vector index; the
  ordering now runs in a subquery over segments alone and answers in 0.4s.

- **Nightly, per town, 03:00 and 03:30 America/New_York** (specs/19 R1.5). The
  poll files submissions; the pipeline ingests what a human approved. Safe to
  leave alone because the pipeline reads `approved` and nothing else.

- **publicrecord.studio is live** (specs/19 R1.7, by a shortcut). Not the
  specs/18 site-move — that needs `control-z-tools` made public — but a second,
  independent GitHub Pages site (`amateurmenace/publicrecord`) with its own CNAME
  serving the cloud-pressed live-first edition. `control-z.org` never moved and
  never went dark; both domains were verified serving, in a browser, before and
  after. The reader at its own address answers a semantic query with meaning
  chips and keeps reading when the API is stopped.

### 2.0.0: Civic Media Studio — the suite takes its own name — 2026-07-18

A major number because macOS agrees it is one: the bundle identifier moved from
`org.control-z.suite` to `org.civicmedia.studio`, so this installs beside the
old app rather than replacing it. The tools are the same tools and the record is
the same record — what changed is that the work finally has names that say what
it is to the people it is for.

- **The suite is Civic Media Studio** (civicmedia.studio). Control-Z keeps its
  own identity inside it — free pro production tools for Resolve, its own site
  at control-z.org, its own audience who may never touch the rest of the stack.
  One `brand/` package holds all of it: four brands, their marks, their tokens,
  and the rules about clearspace and minimum sizes, vendored rather than
  redrawn per surface.

- **The public record is publicrecord.studio.** The reader's mark, every page
  title, the RSS feeds and the web manifest carry it now. The edition is
  branding-only against 1.9.0 — same corpus hash, all 216 issue pages and every
  deep link untouched, because a resident who cited a timestamp in June should
  not find a 404 in July.

- **`record/` — the record gets a home of its own** (specs/17 wave 1). A
  Postgres corpus with pgvector behind the same seam the desk uses, a small
  service in front of it, nightly connectors, and a steward console behind one
  Google sign-in. `memory/` is imported, never forked: one interface, two
  stores, and 83 parity cases that run the hand-audited issue engine against
  both and prove they agree. Nothing is provisioned; `record/INFRA.md` is the
  runbook and `docker compose up` is the proof.

- **The drain, and the desk's fifth wave.** A desk can now lend itself to the
  record (specs/17 §6.4, gated): the meetings without captions queue for any
  station Mac to transcribe on its own hardware, which is how ASR stays at
  marginal zero instead of becoming a GPU bill. Plus Rise on the road, the
  coherence pass across all eight desk pages, and the local Models-page cards
  for MT and vision.

- **Quiet fixes.** `forget()` and `replace_segments` now take a meeting's issue
  links with its segments — they never did, so `list_issues` counted ghosts
  that `issue_appearances` hid, and one issue had two sizes. Public search no
  longer serves meetings the edition withholds. `mint_from_query` stays inside
  its own town. And a three-lane merge that git called conflict-free produced a
  `pyproject.toml` naming a package that no longer exists — valid TOML, broken
  build, caught before it shipped. **685 tests green.**

### Publicrecord — wave 1: the record moves in (specs/17) — 2026-07-18

The public record has been breathing through one Mac: a steward presses a
static edition and pushes it. This is the record given a home of its own — a
Postgres corpus behind the same seam the desk uses, a small service in front of
it, connectors that watch the towns' own channels, and a steward console behind
one Google sign-in. Nothing is provisioned yet and no bill has started; all of
it was built and proven against `docker compose up`, and `record/INFRA.md` is
the exact runbook for the day that changes.

- **One engine, two stores.** `memory/store.py` was the record and the SQLite
  file in one object — the merge-never-shrink rule written out longhand three
  times, bm25's negative score baked into an ORDER BY, the embedding's raw
  bytes escaping into two consumer modules. `memory/seam.py` now writes down
  what the engine may assume of a store, and `memory/policy.py` holds the
  judgement calls. **A store owns dialect; policy owns meaning.** The desk's
  `Corpus` satisfies the interface without inheriting from it, and every
  existing test passed without a line edited — that was the constraint, and it
  is the acceptance test.

- **Publicrecord's store, and the proof it agrees.** `record/store.py` is the
  same record in Postgres with pgvector. `tests/test_record_store_parity.py`
  states 73 guarantees once and runs them twice, and most had never been tested
  anywhere, because they are the failures only a second implementation can
  expose: bm25 is negative where `ts_rank_cd` is positive (port the ORDER BY
  across and you get the *worst* matches first, with every rank-derived score
  silently corrupted); `end` is a reserved word, so even `s.end` will not
  parse; `UPDATE OR IGNORE` has no Postgres spelling and merge uses it three
  times. The clincher is the engine test — `issues.discover`, unmodified,
  finding the same arc across the same meetings on either store.

- **Brookline arrived whole — 16,443 segments, 41 issues, nothing re-derived.**
  The import transliterates rather than recomputes, because that corpus was
  hand-audited and re-running the clusterer would produce *a* set of issues
  rather than *these*. `City Realy` — a caption garble that became a permanent
  issue id — came across as `City Realy`; it is wrong, and it is the record,
  and the steward console's rename verb is the tool for it. The import verifies
  itself: every table counted, vectors re-read bit-for-bit, and the issue
  rollups diffed between the two stores. It found three real defects doing so,
  including an `updated_at` assigned twice in one UPDATE — which SQLite forgives
  and Postgres calls a syntax error.

- **Search that answers in four milliseconds, and says how it found you.**
  `/api/search` blends words and meaning with the provenance chips intact and
  the town scope explicit — the desk's search had never taken a town, which is
  a cross-tenant leak the moment a second town arrives. The neural half is a
  seam pinned to `gemini-embedding-001` at 768 dimensions, stored *beside* the
  lexical vector and never instead of it. With no key, search is lexical and
  the reader is told: *meaning-search needs publicrecord; words still work.*

- **A console with a name against every edit.** The eight curation verbs over
  HTTP, each inside one transaction and each writing an audit row; a review
  queue where the public *Add a meeting* finally POSTs — the specs/16 contract
  shape unchanged — and lands for a steward instead of ingesting blind. With
  auth unconfigured every steward route returns 503: it **fails closed**, and
  there is a test per route saying so.

- **The record reads with the lights off.** The reader is static first, so the
  claim was tested the only way worth testing it: Postgres was stopped, the API
  returned its honest 503s, and the reader went on searching all 16,443
  segments and never noticed. The redirect stubs that will point
  `control-z.org/app/*` at publicrecord are written and deliberately **not run** —
  redirecting a working edition at a Studio that does not exist yet would break
  every civic citation minted so far to fix a problem nobody has.

- **Quiet fixes.** `forget()` now clears `issue_segments`; it never did, and
  `list_issues` counted the orphans while `issue_appearances` hid them, so one
  issue had two sizes. A submission id built from a URL cannot be a path
  segment — `/api/steward/submissions/<id>/approve` silently 404'd for exactly
  the submissions unusual enough to need a human. And the steward console told
  operators to install `google-auth` when they already had it: the package
  imports fine and then fails on its *transport*, so the extra names
  `google-auth[requests]` and the message carries the real error.
  **648 tests green.**

### 1.9.0: the record, drawn — the desk's analytical eye, in public — 2026-07-18

The public edition could read the record; now it can *see* it. What the desk's
Highlighter analyzer and Library did for one editor's screen, the web edition
now does for anyone with a browser — counted from the record's own words, every
mark a link back to the meeting it came from. And the desk grew its own
connective tissue: Index now knows what every clip carries, and one queue job
walks ticked clips through the tools.

- **Every meeting reads like the analyzer now.** A meeting page grew the desk's
  full read: the **eight civic framing lenses** (financial, safety, community,
  environmental, legal… counted, not modeled, each with a first-half/second-half
  drift so a meeting that starts fiscal and ends legal says so), the
  **questions asked** typed by what they ask about (budget, timeline,
  accountability, rationale), and the moments of pushback — all computed at
  press time from the transcript, all readable with JavaScript off.

- **"The record, drawn" — a whole analytics page** (`/app/analytics`). The
  desk's Library, made static: a civic-framing heatmap (meetings down, lenses
  across, each cell shaded by its share), the topics that recur across the
  record, and the names that appear in two or more meetings — every mark opening
  its meeting.

- **The issue graph** (`/app/graph`). The town's concerns drawn as the network
  they are: two issues are tied when they share meetings, the tie thickening
  with every meeting they share, a bigger dot for an issue on more of the
  record. Hand-laid inline SVG — no library, so the strict CSP holds — with a
  table twin for JavaScript-off and screen readers. Tap a node to walk its long
  view.

- **The desk gets what the record got — Index knows what every clip carries.**
  What Memory did for the town's meetings, Index now does for your footage. A
  new sidecar law (`czcore/sidecars.py`) is one table of every mark the tools
  leave beside a source — words, captions, cut, moments, insight, kit, pivot,
  rescue — and one reader, so any tool can ask "what does this clip already
  have?" without re-learning eight naming conventions. The Index shelf opens
  with the library counted in the dashboard grammar — clips, hours, per-kind
  coverage in each owning tool's accent — and turns the one real gap into one
  click, *"words for the N without,"* running Scribe's own engine over the
  wordless as one queue job (silent clips honestly excluded; failures named).

- **The road: ticked clips walk the tools, clip by clip.** Tick clips on the
  Index shelf, pick stages — words (Scribe) · rescue (Clear at road defaults) ·
  reframe 9:16 (Pivot) — and one queue job carries each clip through its stages
  clip-major, so the first is fully finished while the last still waits. The
  plan rules before any engine runs: no sound → no words, no picture → no
  reframe, an unplugged drive → never joins, already made → skipped with the
  reason said; run a finished road twice and the second run is a sentence, not
  an empty queue. A time-coded search hit finally lands Scribe on the moment.

- **Quiet fixes.** The offline service worker's cache is keyed on the release
  version as well as the corpus fingerprint, so a new pressing never leaves a
  returning reader on a stale shell. And a ~7% flake in the job queue's own
  `test_listeners_fire` (pre-existing, unrelated) is gone — it waited on the
  job's status, not the listener's own view. **500 tests green.**

### 1.8.0: the record grows teeth — the paper, the votes, and the loop that keeps it fresh — 2026-07-18

The telescope had the meetings. Now it has what was *written* beside what was
*said*, and *who voted how* — and the public edition closes its loop, so the
record on the web stays as current as the record at the desk. Said as what a
resident can now do: read a town's agenda and minutes on the same timeline as
the tape; see a board's roll call, member by member, each vote a link to the
second it was cast; and open the record on a phone, offline, and be told when a
fresher pressing lands.

- **The town's own paper joins the record (Documents, specs/14 №11).** A new
  `memory/documents.py` pulls a meeting's agendas, minutes, and packets straight
  from the town's portal (CivicClerk — anonymous, no key), extracts and chunks
  the text, embeds each chunk, and links it to the same issues the transcript
  joins — by the same auditable keyword-then-cosine rule. The written record
  interleaves onto every issue timeline with **page-level citations** ("p. 12"),
  and every meeting page carries its paper. What a board *voted* on, a resident
  *spoke* about, and the warrant *wrote down* now sit on one line. (pypdf, pure
  Python — a town without it loses documents gracefully, nothing else breaks.)

- **The Vote Ledger (specs/14 №12).** Roll calls are read straight off the
  transcript — verbatim and timestamped, never inferred. Each is stored with its
  motion, its tally, its outcome, and who said what, and it surfaces two ways: a
  **per-issue ledger** (the roll calls on this thread) and **The votes**, a
  per-member accountability page where every cell links to the moment on the
  tape. Officials only — by *construction*, not by filter: a roll call is the
  board voting, and the town's own agenda supplies the roster that cleans the
  ASR's misheard names. Never a stance, never a private citizen — the record's
  hard non-goals kept. Every surface says: read from the transcript, verify
  against the official minutes.

- **The web edition breathes (specs/16 wave 2).** **Publish the record** presses
  the public edition from the desk's Memory page as one job, reports the edition
  diff (meetings added, issues moved, the fingerprint that changed), and hands
  the steward the push ritual — the desk never deploys itself. The edition now
  carries the documents, the roll-call ledgers, and a **The votes** page, all
  readable with JavaScript off. **Still watching** renders your followed issues
  and their resurfacings from your own browser (follows live only in
  localStorage — export and import them as JSON, anti-lock-in even for
  preferences). And the edition is a **PWA**: a service worker precaches the
  shell and the meetings you've read, an install manifest makes it a home-screen
  app, and a quiet banner says *the record refreshed — reload for the new
  pressing* — all under the same strict, machine-enforced Content-Security-Policy.

- **The record breathes for real.** With eight more Brookline meetings ingested
  (the corpus is ten now, ~72k spoken moments), a followed issue fired a genuine
  cross-time **resurfacing** — a later meeting reopened a thread a resident had
  seen months earlier, and the record woke with a delta that quotes the very
  beads it woke for, timestamps and all.

- **The last two API doors have local hinges (specs/15).** Interpreter's
  translation and Narrator's descriptions were the only features that needed a
  key. Both now try an **on-device model first** and fall back to your key,
  labeling every track by what actually drew it — `czcore/mt_local.py` runs a
  CTranslate2 translation model (the seven panel languages; Simple English stays
  a key-side rewrite, honestly, since it isn't a translation), and
  `czcore/vision.py` runs an ONNX vision-language model for descriptions. Both
  are discovered by the shape of a folder in the models directory, spend no API
  tokens, and add nothing to the AI audit; when no model is installed the status
  line says exactly so and the key path is unchanged. (The model *cards* — a
  hosted, hash-pinned bundle — follow, the way the vits-ljs voice card followed
  its discovery; note the covenant flag: NLLB-200 is non-commercially licensed,
  so a shipped card is a deliberate licence decision, not a quiet default.)

- **The desk gets what the record got — Index knows what every clip carries.**
  What Memory did for the town's meetings, Index now does for your footage.
  A new sidecar law (`czcore/sidecars.py`) is one table of every mark the tools
  leave beside a source — words, captions, cut, moments, insight, kit, pivot,
  rescue — and one reader, so any tool can ask "what does this clip already
  have?" without re-learning eight naming conventions. The catalog reads it: the
  Index shelf opens with the library counted in the dashboard grammar — clips,
  hours, per-kind coverage in each owning tool's accent — and turns the one real
  gap into one click, *"words for the N without,"* running Scribe's own engine
  over the wordless as one queue job (silent clips honestly excluded — listing
  them would be lying; failures named).

- **The road: ticked clips walk the tools, clip by clip.** Tick clips on the
  Index shelf, pick stages — words (Scribe) · rescue (Clear at road defaults) ·
  reframe 9:16 (Pivot) — and one queue job carries each clip through its stages
  clip-major, so the first is fully finished while the last still waits. The
  plan rules before any engine runs: no sound → no words, no picture → no
  reframe, an unplugged drive → never joins, already made → skipped with the
  reason said; run a finished road twice and the second run is a sentence, not
  an empty queue. And a time-coded search hit finally lands Scribe on the
  moment, instead of dropping the timestamp on the floor.

### The web app — wave 1: the record, open in any browser (specs/16) — 2026-07-18

- **The record steps outside.** A new `web/` package presses the whole
  corpus into a static edition — `python -m web.bake` reads everything
  Memory knows and writes JSON, a search index, RSS, caption tracks, and
  per-page HTML into `site/docs/app/`. No backend, no accounts, no
  cookies, no analytics, no video rehosting: the covenant, carried
  outdoors and machine-enforced by a strict Content-Security-Policy on
  every page. A resident with only a phone can search the record and land
  in the tape at the cited second; a journalist selects a sentence and
  **Cites** it with receipts; a screen-reader user reads a meeting as a
  document, because the transcript *is* the page — every meeting is a
  complete, readable HTML document with JavaScript switched off.
- **The whole suite, on one public rail.** The record (Memory) is fully
  alive — Home is a measured dashboard, search runs in the browser, the
  long view draws issue timelines exactly as the desk does. Every other
  tool keeps its seat as a **locked door**: full dignity, a real demo, one
  plain sentence on why it lives at the desk, and the download — locked
  like a door, not hidden like a shame. The web app is the product's
  living tour and the top of the funnel to the desktop app.
- **Honest by construction.** The embed is a click-to-load facade
  (nothing plays, no third party sees you, until you tap). Add-a-meeting
  canonicalizes a pasted link and dedupes against the record — its URL
  canon is a twin of `memory/ingest.py`, pinned by a golden table that the
  reader's own JavaScript answers in the test suite. Anti-lock-in is a
  page element: every meeting downloads as transcript, every timeline as
  data. The bake is byte-idempotent (dates derived from the corpus, proven
  by the manifest hash) and fails loud if an edition busts its size
  budget. Pressed from the real two-meeting Brookline corpus — 30 issues,
  16k segments, 279 KB gzipped — and walked end to end in a browser.

### 1.7.1: one timeline everywhere, the record drawn readable, and the spend in view — 2026-07-18

- **The reel timeline rides every page.** Moments picked anywhere — the
  analyzer's grids, the record's search hits, an issue's beads — land on
  one persistent timeline along the bottom of the screen. Pin it open
  (📌) and it stays across pages and relaunches; fold it and it waits as
  a count. Reorder, drop, jump any chip back to its second on the tape,
  and **▶ Render reel** cuts one montage across every meeting on it —
  URL sessions fetch only the picked seconds, nothing re-downloads.
- **The Library moved in, and learned to draw.** The standalone Library
  page retires; its cross-meeting analytics now live where the work is —
  at the end of Highlighter's Meeting Analyzer (tonight held against the
  record) and behind 📊 Analytics on Memory's landing (the whole shelf).
  Redrawn from scratch: topics as per-1,000-words lines over time,
  framing as a lens-by-meeting heatmap, recurring names as dot-strips —
  readable type, room to breathe, a tooltip on every mark, and every
  mark opens its receipts. The chart colors are the suite's own hues,
  chroma-lifted and **validated for color-vision safety** (worst
  adjacent-pair ΔE 24.9, twice the accessibility target); magnitude
  always rides one violet ramp, identity never repaints. Every receipt
  carries ▶ (land the tape on the second) and ⊕ (join the reel
  timeline) — the pictures are doors now, not decoration.
- **The spend is never a mystery.** Every API call on your key is
  counted from the provider's own token numbers and attributed to the
  tool whose job spent it — no tool had to change a line to be counted.
  Settings grows an **AI audit**: calls, tokens in/out, estimated
  dollars (labeled estimates; your bill is the truth), the fullest
  single call as a percent of the model's context window, and a
  per-tool table. AI surfaces say what each call cost inline (🪙 tokens
  + window share) the moment it lands.
- **czcore/llm.py grows the multimodal door.** `complete_vision()` —
  Narrator's request shape, moved in — so vision drafts ride the same
  guarded key, the same honest errors, and the same ledger as every
  text call.
- **A page can always come home.** A long inner box (a seven-hour
  transcript is 280k pixels of scroll) used to eat every upward wheel
  that crossed it. Now an inner scroller owns the wheel only after you
  step into it; until then the gesture stays with the page. And the
  footer finally reads **designed** + developed.

### 1.7.0: the wing lands — the record, the languages, the voice — 2026-07-18

Three tools in one release — **Community Memory**, **Community
Interpreter**, **Community Narrator** — built in parallel on their own
lanes and merged home together: the biggest single entry since the
suite began. Said as what a resident can now do: search everything
your town has said across every read meeting and land the tape on the
second it was said; follow an issue for years and be told what changed
the day it comes back; read the meeting in your own language, or in
plain English; and hear what's on screen described aloud when you
can't see it. All of it local, labeled, on your own key or none —
beside the official record, never in its place.

- **Community Memory ships (beta) — the telescope opens.** A meeting's
  captions come straight in the moment you paste the link (Scribe
  listens only when a file has no words of its own), the whole corpus
  is searchable, and every hit is a second to jump to — one search
  across every meeting, and the video lands on the moment. Every
  reading shows its receipts and says it's beta.
- **And the telescope learns to see.** Memory finds the issues that
  recur across meetings — vision zero, the golf course lighting,
  short-term rentals — names each from the record's own words, and
  tracks every appearance. Anchored in the words a meeting actually
  says, never a guess about anyone's position. Follow a thread (star
  an issue, or a search) and the record keeps watch: when it resurfaces
  on a new agenda, Memory tells you what changed since last time — a
  paragraph, generative with your key, extractive without one. The
  long view is a line you can walk: an issue's timeline lays every
  meeting along a time axis, its moments as beads and its votes as
  milestones, and every one is a second to jump to. Steward-tended,
  not machine-final: merge two issues, split one that was fused,
  rename or promote a candidate — the record remembers its own edits.
  And "still watching" is a plain digest of your threads you can copy
  anywhere. No email, no account, nothing sent — the covenant, kept.
- **Community Interpreter ships (beta) — the meeting, carried across.**
  Open anything Highlighter has read and pick from the seven panel
  languages — Español, Simple English (plain language, first-class),
  中文, Português, Kreyòl, Tiếng Việt, Русский. One queue job coalesces
  the rolling captions into sentence-shaped cues, translates them
  chunked on your own key with the town's glossary riding every pass
  (do-not-translate names, vetted civic terms — the Brookline seed
  ships honestly marked *suggested*), and lands timed .srt + .vtt
  beside the meeting. Provenance is UI: every track says its model,
  glossary version and review status on the page and inside the .vtt
  itself; lines the model dropped stay English and say so. Every line
  takes one tap to flag into the review queue; a reviewer's correction
  rewrites the track in place. With the full recording local, tracks
  ride the player's own caption menu. No key? The page says so in a
  sentence and still reads existing tracks.
- **Community Narrator ships (beta) — the picture, spoken.** Audio
  description for community TV, a thing public access has essentially
  never had: open a read meeting with its recording and the pass runs
  in three moves — the pauses and the slides mapped (a [Music] or an
  applause marker counts as air, because it is; a shot that holds
  still is a slide, and slides read aloud are the point), each moment
  drafted by vision on your own key in DCMP style with a lint that
  names camera-talk, interpretation and past tense instead of trusting
  the prompt, and every draft waiting on a human accept — nothing
  unaccepted reaches a track. The render speaks each approved line in
  a local voice, ducks the program under the narration with a
  sidechain compressor, and lands four outputs: the mixed program, the
  mixed audio, a program-length narration track, and a descriptions
  transcript that always carries every approved description —
  wall-to-wall programs get the transcript and the extended mode
  instead of a mix that talks over the meeting, never a silent
  failure. Provenance rides the page and the files alike: vision
  model, voice, review status.
- **The wing speaks with one engine each.** `czcore/mt.py` (cue
  coalescing, chunked N|-protocol translation, glossary constraints —
  grown from Highlighter's translate feature) and `czcore/tts.py`
  (sherpa-onnx VITS voices, found by shape) join the middle of the
  table — translation and speech for whatever the wing carries across
  next.
- **The model store learns that a voice is a directory.** A new
  `archive_dir` mechanism keeps a whole member folder from a release
  tarball — manifest-hashed, one auditable line per file, the same
  pinned-hash covenant as every single-file model — and **vits-ljs**
  takes its card: Apache-2.0, the public-domain LJSpeech corpus,
  CMU-lexicon based so no GPL espeak-ng data rides along. Narrator's
  voice is one click now; any other VITS voice placed by hand still
  works, found by shape.
- **Highlighter's record line names the long view.** Beside prior
  appearances, tonight's topics now show as tracked issues — each
  pill a door straight into the issue's timeline on the Memory page.
- **Both lanes' packages join pyproject's truth** (`memory`,
  `interpreter`, `narrator`, the glossary seeds as package-data), so
  a frozen or installed suite imports what a dev checkout already
  found.

### 1.6.0: the wing doubles on paper, and the kit ships itself — 2026-07-17
- **The wiring is ready for Memory before Memory exists.** Highlighter
  and Publisher both carry **⬛ Send to the Record** — dashed and honest
  today ("Community Memory joins in 1.6"), live against the contract
  route the day lane B's `ready` flips, no further edits needed. Every
  loaded meeting carries the record line: prior appearances of
  tonight's topics once the record answers, the promise of it until
  then. And the chain got its hand-offs: **→ Publish kit** from any
  read meeting (pill on the loaded view, chip on every library row),
  publish + rename doors in the Grabber bin.
- **Publisher is ready.** Clip cards carry real frame thumbnails
  (retrying once if the first decode is cold), every copy field has a
  ⧉ copy-to-clipboard button, and the lower-third's two lines are
  editable per kit with the brand's defaults as placeholders. The
  format ladder learned the difference between "mp4" and "plays
  everywhere": h264 preferred explicitly (YouTube ships AV1 inside mp4,
  which the suite's own frame service can't decode), then any mp4,
  then anything, remuxed.
- **The last name tags fall in line** — coming-pages and About carry
  the Community AI Project tag.
- **The app says its real name.** The window, tab, brand and serve line
  all read **Community AI Project** — "the world's most advanced civic
  media suite" beneath. The rail reorders to the mission: Home, the
  **Civic Media Suite** on top (all seven squares), then **control-z ·
  free pro production tools** with the diamonds. BIG Video Grabber
  signs as **Video Grabber**.
- **Home runs the line.** The centerpiece is a conveyor: search + fetch
  → find the moments → make the kit → keep the record — a package rides
  the dashed belt station to station picking up each stop's color,
  coming stations stand dashed with their date, and ▶ Run the line
  drops you at the search desk.
- **The Grabber becomes the search desk.** One query runs YouTube
  (newest first) and the CivicClerk portal in parallel — events arrive
  with video and Zoom links badged, YouTube rows carry → Highlighter
  and Fetch, fetch-all queues the lot. Direct paste downloads at any
  quality — and the container promise is real: mp4-family codecs
  preferred at every rung, lossless remux catching fallbacks, audio-only
  landing m4a. New: **weekly schedules** ("everything from the last
  week, every Thursday at nine" — runs while the app is open, catches
  up on launch, says so), and the **broadcast re-namer** —
  {title}_{date} patterns to playout-safe names, live preview, sidecars
  traveling with the file. The bin grew publish and rename doors.
- **Index opens on the shelf.** The catalog appears on open — newest
  first, grouped by folder, filter chips (all / with words / missing),
  thumbs, → Highlighter on every row; typing narrows, clearing brings
  the shelf back. (The browse lived in the catalog all along; no UI
  ever called it.)
- **The finder takes Highlighter's front door** — town + board search
  first, the paste field second, the drop zone third.
- **One beautiful face for progress.** czProgress: an accent bar that
  shimmers while a job finds its feet and fills when it knows its
  fraction, stage message in mono, a live clock, green on done, the
  sentence on error — on every Grabber fetch and conform, Index scan,
  Publisher render and bundle. And the static cache token grew an
  mtime tail, so an edited file busts the browser mid-version too.
- **The community wing grows by four, and Home strings the wire.** The
  Community AI Project specs moved into the repo (specs/12–15: the
  program plan, Publisher, Memory, Interpreter+Narrator), and all four
  new tools stand on the community rail — one already filled in, three
  as honest coming-pages. Home's new centerpiece is **the wire**: two
  chains showing where one tool hands to the next — *the meeting, start
  to finish* (Grabber → Highlighter → Publisher → Memory) and *seen and
  heard by everyone* (Scribe → Interpreter → Narrator) — every step a
  door, coming steps dashed with their date, and a live-count per chain
  that flips itself the moment a tool turns real. A second machine
  builds Memory in parallel; specs/PARALLEL.md is the two-lane law
  (ownership by file, contracts before code, single-line slots).
- **Community Publisher ships (beta) — program in, kit out.** Open
  anything Highlighter can read and the publish kit builds itself:
  3–5 clip candidates with their reasons on them, cut in 16:9 / 1:1 /
  9:16 through one ffmpeg graph with captions burned as image strips
  (the type matches the brand on any ffmpeg build) and Slate's
  lower-third in the station's colors — bottom-left on widescreen,
  top-left on square and vertical, scaled to the short edge. Copy
  arrives extractive and labeled (titles, description with chapter
  stamps, alt text per clip, newsletter blurb, social drafts); ✨
  redraft spends the user's own key, takes a producer instruction, and
  keeps a way back. Renders run as one queue job; export is a named
  bundle + zip with copy.md, transcript and provenance — nothing left
  to rename. Brand kit is config in app support (station, accent,
  third style, voice) — the In-a-Box tenancy pattern. publisher-cli
  mirrors every move; 13 new tests; proven on the June 18 School
  Committee record.
- **The scorer moved to the middle of the table.** Highlighter's
  moment detection is now `czcore/moments.py` — detection-as-a-service
  for the whole wing (Publisher's candidates today, Memory's issue
  inputs next); `highlighter/highlights.py` stays as a re-export shim
  so every old import and test holds untouched.
- **Stale JS lost its lease.** Every static include carries
  `?v={{version}}`, substituted by the server, and the shell ships
  no-cache — a new build busts the browser's cache by URL, in the app
  window and the browser alike (the "⌘R after relaunch" ritual,
  retired).

### 1.5.0: the meeting answers back, and the heavies install themselves — 2026-07-17
- **The summary writes itself.** Pasting a URL opens a terminal in the
  hero — the commands named as they run, every job message a line, the
  cursor blinking until the meeting opens. With a key configured the
  executive brief is generative on arrival: written on load, cited to
  the second, every [MM:SS] a clickable pill, cached beside the
  transcript so one meeting costs one spend. The extractive read stands
  in until it lands, and stands alone without a key. And the key stays:
  it persists in app support, and an **OpenAI key now works everywhere
  an Anthropic one does** — the key's shape picks the provider.
- **The timeline became an editor.** Every clip on the reel has an edit
  row: nudge in/out by half-seconds, set playback speed (0.5–2×, atempo
  keeps the audio honest), check fade for 0.35s in/out — and every
  choice renders into the export, on both paths (local cut and
  download-and-stitch). The three sections stopped hiding: Meeting
  Highlighter, Highlight Video Editor and Meeting Analyzer stack on one
  page and the anchor pills scroll to them.
- **Exports let go of your hands.** Queued work gets a toast card in the
  corner — label, live percent, the message as it changes, green when
  done — and clicking one opens the Queue, where finished jobs finally
  show WHERE they landed (every output path, click to Reveal) and the
  default output folder is yours to change, right there in Settings.
- **The analyzer reached the web app — and every chart is a door.**
  People, Places & Things is one clickable card: "clips" opens every
  mention as a modal (play each, add any or all to the reel), and 🔍
  Investigate looks a name up in the world — live Google News fetched
  server-side, Wikipedia inline, maps out to the browser, and a "Your
  library" tab that searches every other meeting on this machine for
  the same name. The topic coverage map is a clickable heatmap (topics
  × twelve slices of the meeting), moments of disagreement list the
  tension vocabulary with a red edge, question flow gets type chips
  that open into their questions, speakers open into their own moments,
  and the transcript can Investigate any selection.
- **Generate Full Report** writes the AI narrative plus the counted
  record (decisions, entities, participation, questions) beside the
  meeting as markdown AND a real PDF — czcore/pdfout, a zero-dependency
  writer whose text stays selectable. **Translate** ships both ways on
  your key: the summary inline (and saved), the whole transcript
  chunked into timed .srt/.txt, ten languages.
- **Scrubbing stopped waiting.** The 10-second far seek was the frame
  service JPEG-encoding every frame it walked past on a long-GOP seek;
  passed frames now cache only within a dozen of the target. A cold far
  seek on the 5,223-frame test clip answers in 0.07–0.29s.
- **Stencil answers the click.** A click-preview endpoint runs SAM 2.1's
  image predictor on the one frame being clicked and the plum matte
  appears the moment the subject is chosen — ~3s for the first click
  while the model loads, ~0.7s after. Propagation stays the
  follow-through, not the reveal. And when torch + SAM 2 are absent,
  Stencil gates itself center-page: the card names the ~1 GB one-time
  install and carries the button that performs it (frozen builds get
  the honest sentence instead of a dead button).
- **Every optional heavy has a door now.** Settings grew an "optional
  runtimes" card: Stencil's torch + SAM 2 (pip, Meta's own URL — never
  the PyPI stranger) and Clear's DeepFilterNet3 voice-isolation binary
  (downloaded against its published sha256, refused on mismatch), each
  with installed/missing status, a one-click Install that runs as a
  queue job with live progress, and a copyable terminal command.
  Whisper models stay out on purpose: they download themselves in-app.
- **And the install buttons were then run for real**, in a venv that had
  neither heavy — which caught the SAM 2 one broken: Meta renamed their
  package metadata to `sam-2`, so pip discarded our URL pin
  ("inconsistent name") and went looking for the PyPI stranger instead.
  Every written copy of the requirement now pins
  `sam-2 @ git+…` (the import stays `sam2`). Verified end-to-end through
  the buttons themselves: DFN → sha-matched download → `deep_filter
  0.5.6` answering; SAM 2 → pip → `import torch, sam2` clean.
- **Clear's slider grew its own door.** When the DeepFilterNet3 binary
  is missing, the voice-isolation hint is no longer a wall of install
  text — it's one sentence and a link that lands on Settings → optional
  runtimes, scrolled to and lit up. (The old terminal line survives as
  the link's tooltip.)
- **The analyzer finished the web app's set** — the three cards that
  were still deferred, each local and labeled:
  - **Framing** — eight civic lenses (financial · safety · community ·
    environmental · legal · equity · infrastructure · process), counted
    from the meeting's own words with word-boundary vocabularies, each
    lens carrying its moments (click → play or add to the reel) and a
    first-half/second-half drift. Live on the March 10 Select Board:
    financial ×460 rising, community ×137 fading.
  - **Cross-Reference Network** — entities and recurring keywords that
    share a sentence get a weighted edge; drag the nodes, hover a name
    to light its connections, click a line for the moments the two share,
    click a node for every mention. Honest empty when fewer than three
    names connect.
  - **Relevant Documents** — the town's own CivicClerk portal, read
    around the meeting's date through the Grabber's reader (the title's
    own date wins over upload date; two half-window queries so a busy
    civic calendar can't page the nearest days away; shared word-pairs
    outrank single words so "Select Board" beats half a town of boards).
    Agendas, packets and minutes arrive as typed rows opening the
    portal's real PDFs. Verified live: the March 10 session found its
    own event — Select Board Regular Meeting, 0 days off, agenda +
    packet + minutes — with the same-day committees beneath it.
- The word cloud, recurring topics, and the network stopped counting
  contractions ("we're", "that's") as vocabulary — stopword stems
  wearing an apostrophe.
- **The Meeting Library** — a new room in the community rail: every
  meeting this machine has read, read together. The web app calls this
  its Knowledge Base and asks a cloud model; here every number is the
  same counted per-meeting reading the analyzer shows, aggregated in
  plain code from the sidecars already on disk. Four cards, each a door:
  - **Framing across meetings** — the eight lenses as a meetings × lens
    grid (each column a meeting, oldest first; each cell shaded in its
    lens's color by share), trend chips comparing the library's older
    half to its newer ("financial framing is rising across meetings ↑"),
    every cell opening that meeting's moments.
  - **Entity tracking** — who appears across which meetings and how
    often; a dot per meeting sized by count, one click traces the name.
  - **Meeting comparison** — two meetings side by side: duration, pace,
    decisions with outcomes, questions, tense moments, framing bars, and
    the topics and names they share (outlined) vs carry alone.
  - **Discourse analysis** — one term traced through every meeting
    oldest-first, bars by per-1k-word rate so a seven-hour meeting can't
    out-shout a one-hour one, with the first moments as receipts and
    every row opening the meeting in the Highlighter.
  Sessions that only have captions get read (and cached) on the
  library's first look; a meeting without words is listed as unread, not
  invented. Span downloads and rendered reels are outputs, not meetings
  — filtered by name shape. Verified live on this machine's seven
  meetings: "override" traced ×49 across 3 of 6 — surging in the March
  10 Select Board (×45, 0.85/1k words), echoing in the June School
  Committee.
- **One person, one row.** Caption misspellings used to split a name
  across the analyzer and the Library ("Councelor Hamilton" beside
  "Council Hamilton"). Entity harvesting now folds spellings under a
  conservative match — same word count, same initials per word, high
  sequence ratio — so "Mayor Jan" can never join "Mayor Dan". The
  winning spelling keeps the seat and lists the others (`also`), the
  Library's tracking folds across meetings too (person↔org may join,
  since that split IS the caption noise; places stay strict), and the
  insight cache carries a real version number now so old readings
  rebuild once.
- **The Library grew two cards.** **Topic evolution** — each meeting's
  recurring topics as a grid over time, every cell tracing the term
  through the full transcripts. And an **AI read across meetings** (BYO
  key, labeled generative): one button sends the counted digest — dates,
  lens counts, topics, names, tallies — never a transcript, and the
  answer names meetings by their dates.
- **The suite answers deep links now** — `/#kb` opens the Library,
  `/#clear` opens Clear, and the hash keeps working after load. Small
  feature, two real uses: rooms are shareable, and the site's slide
  captures can find them.
- **The hero carousel shows all thirteen tools** — the five new slides
  (Highlighter, Grabber, Index, Library, Slate) are the real app,
  captured headlessly through its own deep links with the pages driven
  to show their work: the Grabber mid-search on the town portal, Index
  answering "school committee" with thumbnails, the Library's grids
  live. make_slides.py owns the capture (suite_slides — needs the dev
  server and Chrome; skips itself politely without them).
- **The site tells the truth about what shipped.** control-z.org's
  suitebar now reads v1.1.0 shipped / v1.5.0 in signing with all ten
  tools + the Library chipped on it, the six originals flipped to
  shipped with real download links, and Slate, Community Highlighter,
  BIG Video Grabber, Index, and the Meeting Library each got a full
  card — features, quickstart, honest limitations, technical detail.
- **The civic finder means "latest" now.** Searching a municipality used
  to ride YouTube's relevance index — a smattering of the town's year.
  It now asks YouTube's own date-sorted results page ("brookline" leads
  with the newest School Committee and Select Board meetings), with
  civic-looking rows stably on top so vlogs sink and boards rise. (The
  `ytsearchdate` prefix died in the 2026.07 yt-dlp nightlies; the
  results URL with sp=CAI= is the door that stays open. YouTube's date
  sort is bucketed — the newest leads, neighbors may swap.)
- **Stencil stopped asking Metal for a 62 GB buffer.** SAM 2 preloads
  every frame of a state at its own 1024² working size (~12.6 MB a
  frame), so a static-camera meeting — one shot, thousands of frames —
  was one giant refused allocation ("invalid buffer size: 62 GB",
  measured). Long shots now propagate in 240-frame windows (~3 GB
  each), chained by every object's last mask; short shots are untouched.
  Verified on a 576-frame three-window run: seams continuous, masks
  faithful to what the click selected, and the device cache released
  between windows.
- **And the Montage Maker** — a reel cut ACROSS meetings. Every ➕ on a
  traced moment or a framing cell's list lands in the montage tray;
  Render stages the work honestly: local meetings cut in place, URL
  sessions download only the picked seconds (a span already on disk is
  reused — nothing re-downloads), then one stitch where every clip wears
  a title card naming its own meeting. Clips from different meetings
  arrive in different sizes, so the stitch graph now scales everything
  into the first clip's frame, letterboxed, never stretched (this also
  hardens the single-meeting path). Verified: a Select Board moment
  (1080p, fetched by URL) + a School Committee moment (720p, reused from
  disk) → one 19.28s montage, frame-checked — each card carrying its own
  meeting's name and the moment's own clock.

### 1.4.0: the web app's three rooms, the two doors out — 2026-07-17
- **Highlighter wears the web app's exact shape now**: the three sections
  are **Meeting Highlighter · Highlight Video Editor · Meeting Analyzer**,
  and the local pick-the-moments button reads **✨ Make Highlight Reel**
  beside a new **🤖 Make AI Highlight Reel** (BYO key): the model reads
  the timestamped transcript and proposes moments; every pick is clamped
  to the meeting's own clock, spans under 3 s are refused, and the origin
  line says "picks are generative (model, your key) — timestamps
  validated locally". No key → the button isn't there and nothing changes.
- **One big Export Video button, two doors out** (the web app's contract,
  desktop-sized):
  - **🔗 Share a reel link** — the deployed web player's own URL format
    (`?mode=play&v=…&clips=start-end,…&titles=…`), built entirely
    client-side: the clips live in the link, nothing uploads, nothing
    renders. Verified live: a desktop-built link for the March 10 Select
    Board reel loaded in the deployed player — title bar, 1/5 counter,
    Play Reel transport, five progress segments.
  - **⬇ Download & edit on this computer** — one flow with the progress
    stated stage by stage: "1 · Download 5 clips from YouTube — ✓ 5 clips
    landed, only 29s left YouTube" → "2 · Cut the MP4 with ffmpeg (+ title
    cards)" → "✓ Your video" with a Reveal in Finder button. Spans already
    on disk skip the download honestly ("nothing re-downloads"). Local
    files skip straight to the cut. Verified end-to-end: 5 spans → 5 clips
    → one MP4 with 5 title cards, 36.76 s.
- **DaVinci Tools** — a new page in the suite rail: the Node Tree
  PowerGrade, the **Middle Gray Contrast Anchor** (the site's newest
  tool), and the Fusion Template Pack, each with its size, its guide link
  on control-z.org, and a Download that lands in ~/Downloads and reveals
  itself (a dev checkout serves its own bytes; the packaged app fetches
  the same files from the project's GitHub). The OpenFX installer keeps
  its own page, cross-linked. ⌘K knows both pages.
- **The credit footer** — every page now ends with the line that names the
  makers: design + developed by Stephen Walter (weirdmachine.org) with
  Brookline Interactive Group, Neighborhood AI, and Claude Code — part of
  the Community AI Project (communityai.studio).
- 4 new tests (`test_davinci.py`: the three zips exist in the repo, are
  actual zips, guides live on control-z.org, raw URL matches the layout).
  247 pass; the packaging gates remain the signing machine's business.

### 1.3.0: the meeting shows its shape, the reel gets its cards — 2026-07-17
- **The reel can wear title cards now.** One checkbox in the render panel
  and every kept moment gets an ink card before it — the meeting's name
  small, the moment's words big in cream, its timestamp in the brief's
  green pill. Rendered through Pillow with Slate's font discovery at the
  output's own size, and ridden into the SAME concat graph as the cuts
  (`-loop` image inputs + anullsrc silence, every chain normalized to one
  SAR/pix_fmt/48k-stereo so audio stays locked). Works on both paths —
  local-file reels and stitched section downloads, where each `[start-end]`
  clip finds its timeline label by its span. Verified: 5 clips + 5 cards =
  36.76 s, frame-checked. Context, not decoration; hard cuts stay hard.
- **The session has a clock now.** The YouTube embed answers the widget
  "listening" handshake, so URL sessions get what local files always had:
  a ticking time display, the sparkline playhead, and a **follow-along
  transcript** — the row being spoken right now carries a green edge, and
  the *follow* chip scrolls it centered as the meeting plays. Verified
  live: play on the March 10 session → 0:10.2 on the clock and the active
  row tracking the speech. Seeks paint immediately instead of waiting for
  the embed to answer.
- **Analyze shows the meeting's shape — counted, not modeled.**
  - **Meeting pace**: words per minute in 50 bins (the recess is visible
    as a gap in the bars; the March 10 meeting averages 124 wpm).
  - **Discussion dynamics**: three thin lanes — questions asked, decision
    words, tension words — from the same keyword classes the scorer shows
    its reasons with (240 questions counted across that night). Click
    either chart to jump the player there.
- **Agenda, when the upload carries one**: yt-dlp chapters, else timestamp
  lines in the description (the civic upload habit), parsed into a
  clickable agenda card above search. Two items minimum — one timestamp is
  a link, not an agenda — and honest absence otherwise. A fresh re-read
  now MERGES newly scraped fields (title, description) into the session's
  info instead of keeping the thinner one, and when every caption route is
  gated but words are already on disk, the message says exactly that:
  "no caption route today — kept what was already here."
- **8,363 rows stopped being 16,726 event handlers.** The transcript
  renders in 400-row chunks between frames and ONE delegated listener owns
  every keep/seek click. Chart canvases redraw when their tab actually
  shows (a hidden canvas is 0 px wide — it drew into nothing before) and
  on resize.
- **Grabber: a month in one click.** When a CivicClerk search finds more
  than one video, a "⬇ Fetch all N videos" button queues every fetch at
  the chosen quality; the bin fills as they land.
- 8 new tests (`test_meeting_shape.py`: pace bins, dynamics lanes, agenda
  chapters-beat-description / description fallback / one-timestamp-is-not-
  an-agenda, title card lands as a real PNG at size). 246 pass; the same 2
  cv2 packaging gates stand.

### 1.2.0: the meeting reads in seconds, Whisper learns the names — 2026-07-17
- **URL ingest races the web app now — and the routes race each other.**
  YouTube links skip the yt-dlp probe entirely (the id is in the URL), the
  two local caption routes run **concurrently** on threads (first one home
  wins), the metadata rides free on the watch page the caption fetch
  already reads (`captions.parse_video_details`; even a *failed* caption
  fetch hands back the title), and YouTube's empty-200 gate tell breaks
  straight to the community relay instead of waiting out the other doomed
  route. Measured on a 7-hour Select Board meeting from a caption-gated IP:
  **7.4 s** to 8,363 readable segments (the deployed web app, warm, same
  video: 5.2 s — and the desktop's winning route *was* that relay plus two
  honest local attempts; ungated or proxied, the watch page wins in ~2 s).
  **Re-opening a known session: 0.1 s** — a session that's already read
  answers from disk instead of re-asking YouTube. The job message states
  the time and the route: "read in 7.1s — 8363 segments, captions via the
  community service."
- **Whisper gets the names right now — teach it before it listens.**
  faster-whisper's `hotwords` ride through the whole stack (`scribe/
  transcribe.py` → `/api/scribe/transcribe` → both UIs): a comma list of
  people/places/boards the audio likely carries biases the decoder every
  window. Highlighter **harvests the list from the meeting itself**
  (`insight.hotwords()` — entity people first, then places, orgs, names
  scraped from the title; deduped, capped, cut on a comma) and prefills an
  editable field: fix "John Vancoyak" to "John VanScoyoc" before Scribe
  runs and the transcript follows your spelling. Scribe's page grew the
  same field ("teach it the names"). Both model menus add **large-v3 —
  most accurate (names)** above turbo; job labels say "names taught."
- **Downloads say what leaves YouTube.** The Edit panel is now *clips
  first*: one green button — **"⬇ Download highlight clips (N · Ns)"** —
  fetches only the kept spans (merged, keyframe-cut, one file per span,
  named `[start-end].mp4`), with the hint counting what stays behind
  ("only these spans leave YouTube — 5 clips, 29s of a 3:33.0 meeting").
  The **full recording is its own explicit button** below a rule, wearing
  the meeting's duration so nobody grabs 7 hours by accident. Quality
  applies to every fetch and the ladder grew: best / **4K / 1440p** / 1080p
  / 720p / **480p / audio-only** (Grabber's fetch menu got the same rungs,
  and its fetches finally honor a chosen quality instead of always "best").
  Every highlight row grew a **↓ clip** button — fetch just that span.
  Landed clips list themselves under the progress line with **Reveal**
  buttons (`/api/media/reveal` — Finder on the Mac, the file manager
  elsewhere). Verified live: 5 spans → 5 files, each the span's length.
- **AI, bring-your-own-key, never the default** (`czcore/llm.py`). Paste
  an Anthropic key in **Settings → AI** (chmod-600 file, masked to its
  tail, env `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` wins over the file, a stray
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` alone activates nothing) and Highlighter grows two
  labeled *generative* buttons: **✨ AI narrative brief** (bulleted, every
  claim carrying its [MM:SS], rendered as the same clickable pills) and
  **✨ AI** beside Ask (answers ONLY from the retrieval passages, cites
  inline, says so when they don't contain the answer). Long meetings
  stride-sample to fit the budget. Without a key nothing changes anywhere;
  errors are sentences ("the API key was refused (401) — check it in
  Settings → AI" — verified live with a fake key). stdlib urllib, zero new
  dependencies, no key ever ships.
- **⌘K jumps anywhere.** A command palette over the whole suite — type a
  few letters of any tool (or Queue, Models, Settings, About), Enter, and
  you're there. Index rows grew **→ Highlighter** (send any cataloged clip
  straight to the moments-finder), and Highlighter answers transport keys:
  space play/pause, ←/→ ±5 s — never while you're typing.
- 13 new tests (`test_llm_names.py`: key precedence/masking/0600, the
  stray-base-URL guard, watch-page videoDetails parsing incl. the
  shape-change case, hotwords harvest/dedupe/cap). 238 pass; the 2
  standing failures are the known cv2-ffmpeg packaging gates.

### 1.1.0 prep: the icon, the DMG's face, and zero-setup captions — 2026-07-17
- **The suite has an icon**: a cream caret over the amber z — *control z* as
  a rebus. `packaging/make_icon.py` renders it (ink squircle, 2× supersample,
  the suite's own font discovery) and compiles `icon.icns`; the spec wires it
  onto the .app, and the DMG volume wears it too (the custom-icon Finder bit
  does NOT survive `hdiutil -srcfolder` — measured — so the script builds RW,
  sets the bit on the mounted root, converts to UDZO).
- **Version 1.1.0** in both truths; the spec names the Make-wave packages +
  Pillow as belt-and-braces hiddenimports.
- **Community caption service**: when YouTube gates a machine and no proxy is
  set, Highlighter's ingest falls back to the community-highlighter web app's
  own public transcript engine (BIG's deployment, its residential proxy
  behind it). Zero setup for download users, only the public video URL is
  sent, and one Settings switch turns it off. Credentials never ship — the
  relay shares the *benefit* of the Webshare account, never the account.
  Verified end-to-end from a caption-gated IP: 60 segments arrived through
  the service after both local routes failed honestly. Per-video failures
  from the service (HTTP-error JSON) are read and relayed as sentences.
- v1.0.0's release page now explains `realesrgan-x4.onnx` (Rise's model,
  self-hosted at its pinned URL — users never download it by hand).
- `packaging/RELEASE-NOTES-1.1.0.md` is written for the signing machine;
  building/signing/notarizing happens there (this keychain has no identity).

### the Webshare workaround comes to the desktop — 2026-07-17
- **Why:** YouTube now gates caption/timedtext delivery by IP reputation.
  Investigated live: the community-highlighter **web app's Webshare
  residential proxy is active and working** (Render reports proxy_enabled,
  and a transcript fetch through the deployment succeeds in seconds), while
  from a bare home IP every yt-dlp caption route is currently walled
  (android_vr lists no tracks, web wants a PO token, tv trips the DRM
  experiment) and the raw timedtext URL answers with YouTube's empty-200
  gate. Video downloads still work; only captions are gated.
- **`czcore/proxy.py`** — the web app's exact configuration, shared: same
  env var names (`WEBSHARE_PROXY_USERNAME/PASSWORD/HOST`, one account serves
  both apps), or a Settings-page file in app support (chmod 600); same URL
  construction (rotating `-1` session suffix, URL-encoded credentials). The
  status surface masks the username and never returns the password.
- **`czcore/captions.py`** — the web app's transcript mechanism in stdlib:
  watch page → captionTracks → timedtext VTT (manual-English beats auto
  beats other-language), through the proxy when configured. YouTube's
  empty-200 is refused as success and named for what it is, with the fix:
  "Configure your Webshare proxy in Settings → fetch network and retry."
- Every YouTube-facing yt-dlp call (probe, search, captions, downloads)
  passes `--proxy` when configured; the nightly self-update never does
  (that's GitHub, not YouTube). Highlighter's ingest chains: yt-dlp
  captions → watch-page timedtext (+ proxy) → honest sentence; the job says
  which path won.
- **Settings → fetch network**: credential fields, live status ("active
  (tes…on @ p.webshare.io:80)"), Save/Remove; env-var deployments are
  reported and locked from UI edits. The yt-dlp chips on Highlighter and
  Grabber append "· webshare" and say in their tooltip that fetches ride
  the user's residential pool — covenant: it's the user's own account,
  user-configured, used only for the fetches they ask for.
- 13 new tests (URL building/suffix/encoding, env-over-file precedence,
  masking, captionTracks parsing/ranking, video-id forms). Verified live:
  config roundtrip through the API and UI, chip state, and the full ingest
  fallback chain ending in the honest gated-IP sentence from a bare IP.

### Highlighter goes web-app-shaped, the suite goes paper — 2026-07-16
- **Community Highlighter now mirrors the web app** (community-highlighter
  v9.5's shape), rebuilt on local reads that say what they are:
  - **URL sessions**: paste a link → the meeting is *readable before any video
    downloads* — metadata + captions land in a session folder, preview streams
    through a YouTube embed (seek/play by postMessage), and a session whose
    video already sits in the library **borrows the local twin's transcript**
    instead of re-asking YouTube.
  - **Executive brief** with clickable green [MM:SS] pills — extractive, the
    meeting's own sentences, spread across the hour (`highlighter/insight.py`).
  - **Highlights → timeline editor**: reel-style presets (Decisions, Public
    comment, Controversial, Budget, Actions, Everything) drive the scorer; the
    top 5 picks auto-load into a **dark NLE strip** — drag to reorder, trim
    in/out, per-clip thumbs, prev/play/next transport — inside the light app.
  - **Search every word** with a 50-bin sparkline, **word cloud** (civic
    stopwords, top-3 glow), **Analyze** cards: decisions with outcomes,
    entities (people/places/organizations/money, pattern-harvested), speaker
    participation bars, question flow typed by its words, recurring topics.
  - **Ask the meeting** — retrieval, labeled as such: best passages with
    timestamps + follow-up suggestions; never invents prose.
  - **Smart downloads**: the full recording at a chosen quality, or **only the
    kept sections** (`--download-sections` + keyframe cuts, one clip per span)
    which **stitch** into a reel (`stitch_files`). Transcript exports (.txt,
    .srt) are built client-side; **Google Translate** button copies the full
    text and opens the site — the web app's own free path for any language.
  - Civic **Meeting Finder**: yt-dlp's own ytsearch — no API key.
- **The suite turned light.** Paper cream chrome (the site's tokens, the web
  app's cues), ink text, white neo-brutalist cards with offset shadows;
  media surfaces (viewer, filmstrip, scopes, the NLE strip) stay dark on
  purpose — footage lives in the dark, the chrome lives on paper. Highlighter
  wears the web app's brand green (#1E7F63 / #22C55E).
- **Home says "Make Something."**
- **Every open-a-clip surface takes a drop now**: drag a file into any
  viewer (or Clear's waveform, or Highlighter's hero) and it opens; a
  **Browse…** button sits in the center of every empty state instead of only
  up in the media bar. In the app window drops carry real paths (pywebview);
  plain browsers explain themselves instead of failing silently.
- czcore/ytdlp grew `probe_url` (metadata, no download), `fetch_captions`
  (transcript-first ingest), `search` (ytsearch), and per-section downloads
  with multi-file result tracking.
- Tests: 20 new for the insight engine (extractive brief never paraphrases,
  entity buckets, question typing, decision outcomes, participation shares,
  retrieval ask hits and honest misses). Verified live: URL ingest, library
  twin borrow, section-only download (two spans → two clips) → stitched reel,
  full local flow (brief/cloud/analyze/ask), light theme across every page.

### the Make wave: four new tools, three doors, an About — 2026-07-16
- **The suite is ten tools.** Two natives from the long-list spec and the two
  community apps that grew up at BIG, rebuilt on czcore — same jobs, no cloud,
  no API keys:
  - **Community Highlighter** (`highlighter/`) — meeting video becomes text,
    text becomes the reel. Fetch via the managed **yt-dlp nightly** (a check
    runs on *every* page open and the chip says what it found); YouTube
    captions seed the transcript instantly (word timing when YT provides tags),
    one click upgrades through Scribe's local pass; the scorer marks moments
    with **its reasons on every pick** (decision/money/community/tension
    keywords, emphasis, optional room-energy blend); keep/drop paragraphs and
    render the reel (one ffmpeg concat graph, hardware encode) or leave with a
    selects EDL through Scribe's own exporter.
  - **BIG Video Grabber** (`grabber/`) — CivicClerk search for any tenant
    (Brookline default; every URL-shaped field harvested and labeled, bare
    `youtubeVideoId`s synthesized into links), fetch through yt-dlp *or* the
    new **zoomshare resolver**: Zoom and **zoomgov.com** share pages resolved
    with four plain HTTP requests — the flow the old app drove Puppeteer
    through, multi-clip aware, every failure a sentence naming the step. Then
    conform for air: constant-rate pass, shared encoder presets, PCM into mov.
  - **Index** (`indexer/`, tool id `index`) — the footage librarian. Folders →
    SQLite catalog (FTS5 with LIKE fallback), incremental rescans, missing
    drives stay listed and say so; plain-word search returns clips *and
    time-coded transcript hits* read from Scribe sidecars; selects leave as a
    **FCPXML stringout** (new `czcore/exports/fcpxml.py` — NTSC-exact
    rationals, percent-encoded file URLs) or CSV.
  - **Slate** (`slate/`) — the station graphics kit. The **lower-third maker**
    renders type at 2× through Pillow and downsamples Lanczos; four styles
    (bar/block/line/clean), slide/rise/fade with cubic easing, live preview
    *through the export code path* on an alpha checker with safe-area cages;
    exports **ProRes 4444 with real alpha**, PNG stills, and animated GIF
    (labeled honestly: 256 colors, web use). Plus SMPTE bars + 1 kHz tone,
    a countdown leader with beeps, and a program-slate card.
- **Home is three doors.** Prep / **Make** / Finish — "What are we creating
  today?" Grabber joins Prep (footage on its way in); Make holds Highlighter,
  Index, Slate. The community pair keeps its own rail corner: square glyphs,
  BIG-blue section header, accent-washed rows — deliberately a little
  different, same covenant.
- **About page** — the suite's story, the covenant with meanings, this build's
  numbers, and the website footer's credits verbatim.
- **Shared plumbing:** `czcore/ytdlp.py` (nightly manager: GitHub check with
  60s cooldown, atomic binary replace, offline = a sentence and the old build
  keeps working; downloads print progress and survive failed caption fetches),
  `czcore/ffrun.py` (ffmpeg with `-progress` parsing + cancel),
  `czcore/paths.py` (outputs land in `~/Movies/control-z/<tool>`), four new
  CLIs, packages/scripts registered, `pillow` added to requirements.
- **Fixed en route:** reel output paths built with `with_suffix()` could
  resolve to the *source* filename (`meeting.reel` → `.mp4` strips `.reel`) —
  outputs are appended now and an equality guard refuses to overwrite the
  source; sidecar discovery used `glob()` on names carrying `[id]`, which glob
  reads as a character class and never matches — replaced with `startswith`
  everywhere; yt-dlp subtitle requests narrowed to `en,en-orig` (asking for
  `en.*` pulls every translated variant and trips YouTube's 429, which used to
  kill the whole fetch — a landed video now survives a failed caption).
- Tests: 42 new (scoring/reel merge sweep/VTT word tags, nightly version
  compare, CivicClerk parsing incl. zoomgov + bare-id synthesis, zoomshare URL
  matching, FCPXML rationals/escaping/offsets, catalog search + FTS quoting,
  lower-third clamping/easing/alpha per style). Verified live end-to-end:
  real YouTube fetch → caption-seeded transcript; real Brookline zoomgov
  Select Board recording resolved to its mp4 (ranged probe, 3.99 GB, `ftypmp42`);
  detect → reel render (hardware h264, audio locked) → selects EDL; Index
  scan/search/FCPXML on disk; Slate ProRes 4444 (`yuva444p12le`) + PNG + GIF.

### the Fusion template pack — ten setups, paste-tested — 2026-07-16
- **The pack is now ten templates, and every one has been pasted into a live
  Fusion comp in free Resolve** (build 21, via the scripting API) — the caveat
  that said "not yet paste-tested" is gone because the test was actually run.
  Real mattes drove each one: `depth-cli run` on the Pexels street clip,
  `stencil-cli run` on the portrait.
- **The existing five were broken in a way the tests couldn't see, and are
  rebuilt.** `fog`, `depth-grade` and `haze-light` used a `Bitmap` node to key
  the matte — but `Bitmap` is not a valid Fusion RegID; Resolve silently turns
  it into a no-op **Dummy** on paste (no image input, no output), so those three
  produced *nothing*. The correct node is **`BitmapMask`**. All three now key
  through BitmapMask, and — because the depth matte is near=white — the fog and
  haze masks are **inverted** so the *far* end mists/glows, which the old ones
  got backwards too.
- **`rack-focus` was wired to an input that isn't there.** Its note said to feed
  the depth matte into `VariBlur.Blur`; VariBlur's blur-map input is actually
  **`BlurImage`**, and driving real focus needs a distance-from-plane map, not
  the raw depth. Replaced the `BrightnessContrast` gain hack with a **`Custom`**
  node computing `max(abs(depth − focal) − tolerance, 0)` — an animatable focal
  plane on `NumberIn1`, feeding `VariBlur.BlurImage`.
- **`depth-grade` shipped masks and no grade.** It was three (Dummy) Bitmaps and
  a note saying "feed these to a ColorCorrector yourself." Now it's a real
  paste-and-go tree: three `BitmapMask` bands (near / mid via a subtract / far
  via invert) each driving its own neutral **`ColorCorrector`**, chained.
- **`parallax` and the tool ids we *assumed* were wrong turned out fine.**
  `Displace` (`Type`, `XRefraction`, `YRefraction`) and `VariBlur` are real
  free-edition nodes with the names we guessed; parallax only needed its
  displacement source actually connected and subtler default refraction. Logged
  so the next person doesn't re-audit them.
- **Five new templates**, built and verified the same way:
  - **`veil-blur`** (the headline): blur *inside* a Stencil matte with a
    grow/feather so edges don't leak — plus a **mosaic** variant in the same
    file, bypassed by default. The mosaic needed a `Scale`-down→`Scale`-up
    (nearest) pair, **not** two `Transform`s: Fusion concatenates adjacent
    Transforms into one clean resample, so the block pixelation vanished until
    Scale (which changes real resolution) forced it. Honest note points at the
    per-frame check.
  - **`cutout`** — Stencil ProRes-4444 alpha over a new `Background`, alpha
    tunable through a `MatteControl` rather than trusted.
  - **`matte-tune`** — `ErodeDilate` + `Blur` on any matte, with two viewer
    outputs: the tuned matte alone, and the matte as a red tint over the image
    (the QC bench the other templates assume).
  - **`confidence-grain`** — `FastNoise` grain merged (SoftLight) through Hush's
    clean-confidence **alpha**, so grain lands where the denoiser averaged
    deepest. Note points at Speak as the better path.
  - **`social-vertical`** — 9:16 canvas, source full-width on a scaled+blurred
    backdrop of itself. Tuned the fit once we saw a 16:9 source lands full-width
    (Size 1.0) in a 1080×1920 comp and the backdrop needs ~3.2× to cover height.
- Every template: `CZ*` node names, exactly one sticky `Note` naming each wire,
  nothing auto-gains (grade/tune nodes are neutral, grain sits at Blend 0.35).
- `depth-cli templates` writes all ten (`--pack depth|stencil|all`, descriptive
  `cz-depth-` / `cz-stencil-` / `cz-hush-` filename prefixes). The zip is
  rebuilt by a reproducible `packs/build_zip.py` (byte-stable). Tests extended:
  per-template balanced braces, expected tool ids present, a `Note` present, and
  **no Studio-only / `Bitmap`-Dummy tool ids** in any file — plus CLI-writes-ten
  and zip-lists-ten. 146 green.

### loose ends — 2026-07-16
- **Speaker labels install themselves now.** Scribe's diarization needed two
  files fetched by hand — one of them buried in a tarball — and because they
  weren't in the registry the Models page could delete them but not bring them
  back. Both are registered, hash-pinned and license-carded like every other
  model; `czcore.models` learned to keep one named member out of a tarball
  (by exact name — never a blanket extractall, which lets an archive write
  where it likes). First use downloads ~44 MB and says whose weights they are.
- **The depth CLI stopped hoarding frames.** `depth-cli run` held a
  full-resolution float32 map for every frame of a shot, the same bug the
  Suite's render had: 845 KB/frame at SD, gigabytes at 4K. It now keeps the
  model's native 256×256 map like the Suite does — 256 KB/frame regardless of
  source resolution, so a 659-frame 4K clip holds 165 MB where it used to ask
  for 21.7 GB.
- Home's doors split by direction of travel rather than by a timeline the
  tools don't follow: Prep is footage on its way into your editor (Clear,
  Stencil, Depth), Finish is the cut coming back out (Pivot, Scribe, Rise).

### suite 0.4.0.dev0 — suite services — 2026-07-16
- **Install OpenFX page** (specs/08 §5): detects Resolve and
  /Library/OFX/Plugins, reads installed Hush/Speak versions from their
  Info.plists, and checks the latest GitHub release on click — one GET to
  the public API, nothing phones home on its own; prerelease-only repos
  (Speak beta) resolve via the release list and wear a beta badge. Install
  downloads the release .pkg to ~/Downloads and opens the system installer
  (which owns the privileges — the plugins dir is root-owned and the page
  says so instead of pretending). One-click OFXPluginCacheV2.xml clear for
  the rescan gotcha; uninstall removes the bundle when the dir is writable
  and otherwise prints the exact sudo command. Verified against this
  machine's real state: Resolve found, Hush 3.3.0 → v3.7.0 update offered,
  Speak not-installed → v0.2.0 beta offered.
- **Models page**: the czcore registry with license + sha-256-pinned badges
  and true on-disk sizes, download (through the queue, hash-verified) and
  remove per model; whisper cache and Stencil runtime status. Verified: yunet
  removed and re-downloaded with its hash checked. Whisper is the one row the
  registry doesn't own — faster-whisper fetches those from Hugging Face
  itself, unpinned, and the page says so rather than implying otherwise.
- **Settings page**: every cache with its real size and a clear button
  (all regenerable — the page says nothing here can lose work), job-history
  clear (active jobs never touched — unit-tested), model store and app-data
  paths, about block.
- Queue page grew a "clear finished" button; czcore JobManager grew
  clear_finished().
- The rail has no coming-soon states left: v0.4 closes the milestone list
  short of v1.0 (packaging, signing, notarization, DMG).
- **v0.2, sound + words.** **Clear**: audio workspace (waveform + amber-on-ink
  spectrogram with before/after A/B), rescue chain from the CLI's own calls
  (de-hum auto-detect, de-click, DF3 isolation when the binary exists — honest
  hint when not, de-ess, loudness presets), video remux against the untouched
  stream, room-tone generator, and the covenant surfaces: a "what was removed"
  monitor chip playing the residual, loudness I/peak meters, and a residual
  by-band null test ("presence band loud = you're eating words"). Verified on
  synthesized degraded dialogue: found the injected 60 Hz hum + harmonics,
  repaired the clicks, presence band read −16.5 dB (quiet).
  **Scribe**: the transcript-first editor — word-click seeks, karaoke follows
  the audio clock with the caption overlaid on video (current word amber),
  low-confidence words tinted (proof those), inline segment edits saved to the
  sidecar, speaker rename everywhere, caption presets, SRT/VTT/TXT/marker-EDL
  exports, and the pull list → CMX3600 selects EDL in source TC. Verified: two
  TTS voices separated perfectly, 23 s transcribed in 16 s (base), selects EDL
  honors embedded TC.
- **v0.3, the GPU pair.** **Depth**: false-color scrub (source/blend/depth),
  click-to-probe crosshair reading the local map, histogram with draggable
  in/out handles, stability meter, matte render (10-bit gray ProRes,
  edge-guided, temporal EMA with cut resets) through the queue, Fusion
  template pack writer. Honest note in the UI: scrub previews are per-frame;
  the render smooths. MiDaS-small fetched hash-verified on first use.
  **Stencil**: click-to-prompt (⌥-click excludes), SAM 2.1 propagation through
  the queue, matte tint + onion skin overlays, the confidence-strip QC loop
  (0.85 threshold line, low frames named), coverage %, post chain
  (grow/feather/despeckle/temporal majority) and luma / ProRes-4444-alpha
  exports. The runtime stays an honest optional — the page says exactly what
  to install when it's missing. The ⌥-click exclude only works at all because
  of the multi-point prompt fix below: on the old engine every click after the
  first was silently discarded, so a prompt ending in an exclude produced an
  empty matte.
- New engine deps into the venv story: faster-whisper, sherpa-onnx, soundfile,
  scipy, pyloudnorm (+ torch/sam2 as Stencil's optional heavies).
- Suite rail: no coming-soon states left among the tools — Install OpenFX,
  Models, Settings remain v0.4.

### czcore.denoise — the Hush core, ported — 2026-07-16
- **Pivot and Rise now carry Hush's denoising**, because both make noise
  worse (punch-ins scale it up; SR models synthesize texture from it).
  `czcore/denoise.py` is a faithful vectorized port of Hush-OpenNR's
  `nr_core.h` reference: the noise estimator (fine + coarse |Laplacian| and
  |temporal diff| medians with Hush's calibration constants, 16-bin
  brightness gain curve), the hard-knee gated 3-frame temporal merge with
  Ghost Guard and per-neighbour exposure offsets, the two-scale residual
  re-measure, and the fine NLM band (bias-corrected, edge-aware Preserve
  Detail). Hush defaults throughout. Honestly NOT ported (still plugin-only):
  shift-search motion tracking, firefly zapper, Render Boost, Deep Clean,
  medium/coarse EQ bands, the refine texture stack — reports say
  "hush-core", never plain "Hush".
- Wiring: Rise cleans BEFORE scaling (suite checkbox default on; CLI
  `--denoise`; preview cleans the patch so the A/B compares scalers on what
  the render will feed them). Pivot cleans the crop before any scaling with
  the temporal neighbours cropped at the CURRENT frame's rect — the stack
  stays registered while the camera path moves (suite checkbox, default
  off). Both paths use a 1-frame lookahead and put the measured σ in the
  report.
- Verified: 9 golden tests (estimator accuracy, +12 dB static-trio PSNR,
  motion no-ghosting, edge survival, near-identity on clean, determinism);
  on the real SD test clip the cleaned ×2 output measures ~45% less luma
  noise (0.39% → 0.22%) and ~54% less chroma than the plain ×2. Cost:
  ~160 ms/frame SD, ~1.6 s/frame 1080p — roughly halves Rise throughput,
  named in the UI.
- Brand line updated everywhere: control-z is "free cleaning, prepping, and
  finishing tools for DaVinci Resolve" (app rails, tool docstrings, README,
  pyproject, site templates + rebake).

### suite 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- **The Suite desktop app lands** (specs/08): one FastAPI + WebSocket server
  over the existing engines, single-page UI (hand-written HTML/CSS/JS, no
  framework) in a pywebview window — `python -m suite`, `--serve` for a
  browser. Grade-room design per spec §6: ink/forest surfaces, cream text,
  amber for measurements only, per-tool accents, node-wire rail indicator.
- Shell: rail with honest coming-in-v0.x pages for the four tools not yet
  moved in, Home with Prep/Finish doors + recents, shared viewer (zoom/pan,
  A/B wipe, canvas overlays, JKL + arrows; nb_frames metadata treated as an
  estimate and clamped to the decodable truth), filmstrip, Easy/Studio
  inspector density remembered per tool, scope rack (histogram + waveform
  on every image tool).
- Jobs: czcore.appshell grew a persistent SQLite queue — FIFO worker,
  cooperative cancel, history survives restarts, jobs killed by a quit are
  recorded as interrupted. WebSocket events + poll fallback; cross-tool
  Queue page. The legacy immediate mode is unchanged (pivot micro-UI still
  green).
- Frame service: PyAV decode → cached JPEGs at viewer height with prefetch
  around the playhead; frame indices derived from pts (frame-accurate on
  CFR, golden-tested against a painted synthetic clip); past-EOF is a 404,
  never an aliased frame.
- Export presets in czcore.media: ProRes 422/HQ (hardware
  `prores_videotoolbox` when present, `prores_ks` fallback), ProRes 4444
  (+alpha), DNxHR HQX, H.264/HEVC (VideoToolbox, libx264/5 fallback) —
  every render reports the encoder that actually ran and passes color tags
  through untouched (and says so). Validated by real encodes.
- **Pivot moved in fully** (old page prints a retirement note, still works):
  analyze warms the scrub cache during its own decode pass, path-trace +
  punch-in scopes, per-shot overrides re-solve in place, render through the
  export panel, Fusion .setting export. Verified end-to-end on the 4K
  reference clip: 659/659 frames of ProRes 4444 (ffprobe-counted), bt709
  tags carried, override → punch verified, 1318-key .setting written.
- **Rise moved in**: probe + interlace guard (combed sources refused with a
  sentence; Studio-only bypass), A/B wipe against honest bicubic, detail
  heatmap = |model − bicubic| with an added-energy readout, model picker
  showing true on-disk availability, batch → queue. Verified: 96/96-frame
  batch through hardware ProRes; a 4K job cancelled mid-run removed its
  partial file. `rise.video.upscale_video` extracted from the CLI (CLI
  behavior unchanged); `resolve_model("auto")` now falls back to lanczos
  when the ONNX isn't converted instead of crashing.
- Tests: 119 green (26 new — job store persistence/cancel/interrupt, frame
  cache accuracy/EOF/mtime-keying, export preset mapping/alpha honesty).
- Honest limitations: previews are proxy JPEGs (native-pixel loupe planned),
  one job runs at a time, jobs are threads not worker processes (isolation
  arrives before Stencil's propagation), no drag-drop into the webview,
  headings fall back to system fonts (Space Grotesk/DM Sans not bundled),
  Windows untested.
- Trap for the file: FastAPI + `from __future__ import annotations` +
  a function-local `WebSocket` import makes every /ws connect 403 silently
  (string annotations resolve against module globals) — keep FastAPI names
  imported at module level.
### stencil — 2026-07-16 (bug fix)
- **Multi-point prompts were broken and silently produced empty mattes.**
  SAM2's `add_new_points_or_box` defaults to `clear_old_points=True`, so
  sending one point per call kept only the last — a prompt ending in an
  exclude point erased the matte entirely (confidence 0.00 on every frame).
  Points are now grouped by (frame, object) and sent in one call:
  the same prompt set went 0.00 → **0.98 mean confidence, 0 frames flagged**.
  Found while re-shooting the site demos; regression test added
  (`TestPromptGrouping`). The old single-point demo worked by luck.

### site (licensed demo footage) — 2026-07-16
- **No member footage on the site.** Every published demo frame was re-shot on
  freely-licensed clips — the previous frames came from private member footage
  we don't hold public rights to. `site/make_slides.py` documents the
  licensing rule at the top so this can't regress. Hush's before/after stays
  its own synthetic validation card.
- The people-images are Pexels clips chosen so each is also a harder demo, and
  so the people shown reflect the communities these tools are for (curly-hair
  portrait for Stencil/Speak, freckled close-up for Rise, city street for
  Pivot/Depth). The Pexels license asks for no attribution; the footer credits
  them anyway, because a project about giving work away should say whose work
  it borrowed. An earlier pass used Tears of Steel (© Blender Foundation,
  CC-BY 3.0); it now stays in Test Footage as a spare scope-format source and
  no longer ships.
- Every frame is still real tool output: Stencil's matte is a genuine SAM 2.1
  propagation (0.98 confidence), Pivot's box is a genuine solved 9:16 crop,
  Depth is the shipping engine, Rise is real Real-ESRGAN vs Lanczos.
- Rise demo re-sourced from an in-focus face crop — the old pair came from a
  defocused region, so reconstruction read as blur; it now reads sharp AND
  denoised, which is the actual behavior.
- Pivot slide centre-crops the 2.4:1 scope frame to a true 16:9 first, so its
  "16:9 → 9:16" label is literally what's drawn.
- **Speak is live**: status `beta` (new status tier), real download links to
  github.com/amateurmenace/Speak v0.2.0, copy/limitations taken from its
  README (early beta, macOS-only binaries, no preset library yet).
- Domain cutover: control-z.org released from Hush-OpenNR and claimed by this
  repo; CNAME is now written by `site/build.py` on every bake so a deploy
  can't drop it. hush-whitepaper.pdf carried alongside whitepaper.html.

### site (single-page rebuild) — 2026-07-16
- One-page architecture: tool pages retired; each tool is a homepage section
  (`#t-<id>`) with its live simulation, feature list, brief how-to, and a
  `<details>` technical expander (architecture, model card, honest limitations,
  replaces). Node tree + chips now anchor-jump. Stale pages cleaned at bake.
- Epic dark hero (white-paper band promoted): philosophy/why + four value
  cards over live grain; CTA row (suite download, tools, design study).
- New sections: Downloads (Suite app card, Hush/Speak OpenFX, white paper —
  carried into the bake from Hush-OpenNR/docs), DaVinci + Premiere guide
  cards, "Who is this for?" (stations section retired into it), free-toolbox
  grid on the homepage (9 tools with blurbs/links).
- Topline: "A Weird Machine project in collaboration with Brookline
  Interactive Group" (linked). Footer: designed/developed credit (Stephen
  Walter × Claude Code · 2026), Weird Machine logo, Community AI Project
  (communityai.studio) + BIG partnership line, MIT license link.
- specs/08-suite-app.md: the control-z Suite desktop app scoped (architecture,
  IA, per-tool workspaces, export contract incl. ProRes 4444+alpha, OpenFX
  installer page, design language, milestones, risks, build-session prompt).

### site (interactive redesign) — 2026-07-16
- Rebuilt on the Hush site's actual component vocabulary (studied
  `Hush-OpenNR/site/index.template.html`): Space Grotesk/DM Sans, mono topline,
  amber-period hero, `.pcard` pair cards, `.feat` chips, dark `.ntree` with
  animated wire dots + click/keyboard node selection, `.wipe` before/after
  slider, grain-canvas `.study` bands, auto-cycle-until-click tabs, scroll-
  animated chart bars, numbered install steps, tipcards. Assets baked base64.
- Homepage: live Hush wipe in the hero (real footage); the suite as a clickable
  Resolve-style node tree in true pipeline order (restore→edit→sound→color→
  deliver, Speak last in color); audience tabs auto-cycle and relight the tree;
  Hush×Speak pair cards; grain-band covenant; "money undone" animated chart.
- Per-tool interactive demos, all real data or real math: Hush + Rise wipe
  sliders (actual outputs), Pivot solver playground (the shipping controller
  ported to JS — drag the subject), Scribe paper-edit (its own diarized
  transcript; clicks emit a real CMX3600 EDL), Clear WebAudio room (synthesized
  hum/room/voice with de-hum, isolate mix-back, and "listen to what's removed"),
  Depth probe + depth-shaped fog (real engine data), Stencil confidence-strip
  QC loop, Speak mini node-tree. All verified in-browser.

### site — 2026-07-16
- control-z.org rebuilt as the suite site per specs/07: Jinja2 bake to
  `site/docs/`, data-driven from `content/tools.yaml`. Homepage pipeline map
  (lit/breathing nodes, audience filter chips), tool-page template (verbline,
  replaces strip, quick start, model card, honest limitations), roadmap
  (proposed tools live ONLY there), mission/stations/toolbox pages.
  Not yet deployed: CNAME move + Hush-OpenNR/docs redirects happen at launch.

### stencil 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- SAM 2.1 video propagation (torch/MPS), prompt-file CLI, matte post chain
  (temporal majority, grow/feather/despeckle — golden-tested), luma +
  ProRes 4444 alpha exports, per-frame confidence with low-confidence frame
  report (the covenant surface). Verified on 4K footage (~2 fps propagation
  on M1 Max at 720p analysis). Deferred: click UI (v0.2), ONNX diet (v0.3).

### scribe 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- faster-whisper transcription (word timestamps, VAD), sherpa-onnx
  diarization (verified: 2-voice test separated perfectly), SRT/VTT with
  broadcast/social caption presets, TXT, marker EDL (speaker-colored,
  free-Resolve importable), CMX3600 selects EDL from pull lists. NDF
  timecode math golden-tested (23.976 drift documented). Deferred: editor
  UI (the v0.2 centerpiece), FCPXML.

### clear 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- De-hum (auto 50/60 Hz detect + harmonic notches, >20 dB kill golden-tested),
  de-click (second-difference detector — IIR ringing bug found and fixed;
  rarity guard so speech never counts as clicks), DF3 voice isolation via the
  official deep-filter binary (PyPI package is unmaintained — learned the hard
  way), room tone (random-phase PSD resynthesis, loop-safe), loudness
  normalize (BS.1770, refuses to hide peak conflicts), residual export
  ("listen to what was removed"). Deferred: UI, video remux, Demucs deep
  mode, nih-plug VST3.

### rise 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- Real-ESRGAN x4 converted from official BSD-3 weights to our pinned ONNX
  (rise.convert), tiled inference with seam-free overlap blending
  (golden-tested vs whole-frame), beats-bicubic golden test, honest lanczos
  fallback, CLI with interlace guard (refuses combed sources) and flow-gated
  temporal stabilization. Engine live inside Pivot's --enhance.

### depth 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- MiDaS-small ONNX backend (MIT) behind a model-agnostic engine (VDA-Small
  planned), temporal EMA with shot-boundary resets, per-shot robust
  normalization, He-et-al guided-filter edge-aware upsampling, 10-bit gray
  ProRes matte export, false-color previews, five-template Fusion pack
  (fog / rack focus / depth grade / parallax / haze light). Verified on 4K
  footage. (Pack later paste-tested + rebuilt + grown to ten — see the
  unreleased entry at the top.)

### pivot 0.2.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- Web UI (czcore.appshell: FastAPI + local page): open clip, analyze with
  progress, scrub preview with crop overlay + subject dot, path-trace sparkline
  (targets vs solved path), per-shot mode overrides (re-solve in place),
  render + Fusion export from the page. Verified end-to-end in a browser.
- Fusion `.setting` export: animated Crop with one keyframe per frame
  (czcore.exports.fusion_setting) — the free-Resolve keyframe roundtrip.
  NEEDS a paste-test in Resolve before release.
- YOLOX-s person detection (Apache-2.0, hash-pinned), lazy "auto" mode: runs
  only on frames with no face; per-shot subject falls back face → person.
- rise.engine seed: frozen upscale API, tiled ONNX runner ready, honest
  `lanczos` fallback backend (labeled, never claims synthesis). `--enhance`
  wired into render + UI.
- Sidecar v1 now stores raw targets per aspect (enables instant re-solve).

### pivot 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- Path solver (punch/follow, deadzone+hysteresis, lookahead anticipation,
  jerk-limited motion; overshoot pinned at ≤4·a_max by golden tests) + presets
  (calm/standard/attentive).
- Shot detection (adaptive luma-diff, czcore.shots), greedy face tracker
  (YuNet, MIT, hash-pinned auto-download), per-shot subject selection.
- Renderer: frame-accurate (EOF flush handled), native-res crops (no silent
  upscale), audio stream-copy or honest skip, h264/hevc/prores.
- CLI: analyze / render / auto with per-shot QC report; sidecar JSON v1.
- Verified end-to-end on 4K ProRes footage (659/659 frames). Known v0.1 limits:
  faces-only detection (subjects lost when the face is undetectable — persons
  model lands in v0.2), no y-axis eyeline offset yet, no Fusion export yet.

### czcore 0.1.0.dev0 — 2026-07-16
- shots (pure cut detector + PyAV diffs), media probe parser, model store with
  sha256 pinning + license cards. 51 tests green (stdlib-only run).
