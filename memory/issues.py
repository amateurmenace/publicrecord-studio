"""The issue engine — the telescope's optics.

Highlighter reads one meeting; this makes *civic time* legible: it finds the
topics that recur across meetings and years, names them, and tracks every
appearance so a resident can follow a thread and catch up on an arc in one
sitting.

How it decides what an issue *is* — and why it is built this way. The suite's
embedding is lexical (hashed n-grams, no model — the covenant made literal), and
civic meetings share a large baseline vocabulary, so partitioning segments by a
cosine threshold collapses everything into one "a public meeting" blob (measured,
not guessed). So issues are **anchored in distinctive vocabulary** instead: the
multi-word phrases that recur across meetings — *vision zero*, *short term
rentals*, *the golf course lighting* — are the anchors, phrases that co-occur are
merged into one issue, and each issue carries a **keyword set** (its aliases plus
the words most enriched in its own passages). That set is the visible, auditable
surface: a segment belongs to an issue because it *says* one of the issue's
words, not because an opaque vector said so. Assignment is keyword-first (high
precision, high recall when the aliases are good); a conservative cosine
fallback catches a near-miss, and everything else waits in a candidate queue for
a steward — the spec's design, exactly.

Generative only on top: labeling and the resurfacing delta go through
`czcore.llm` **when the user has a key**, and every one has an extractive
fallback that stands alone. No stance is ever inferred about a person — a hard
non-goal. Memory supplements the official record; it never replaces it.
