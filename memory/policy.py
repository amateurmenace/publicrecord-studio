"""The record's rules, held apart from the SQL that stores them.

Everything here was inside `store.py` when there was one store. A second store
is arriving (specs/17: the desk keeps SQLite, publicrecord gets Postgres), and
the day two stores exist, every rule left inside one of them is a fork waiting
to happen — the merge-never-shrink policy was already written out three times
in one file, and a Postgres port would have made it four.

So the split is: **a store owns dialect, this module owns judgement.** How a
row merges, how a search blends, where the vector floor sits, what counts as
the same meeting, which columns are too heavy to list — those are answers about
the record, and they must be the same answer at a desk in Brookline and on a
server the town never sees. The SQL that carries them out is allowed to differ;
the answers are not.

Nothing here touches a database, so all of it is testable without one, and both
stores import it rather than re-deciding.
