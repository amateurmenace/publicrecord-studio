"""One interface, two stores — what the engine is allowed to assume.

`memory/` is the civic-record engine: ingest, issues, votes, documents, the
analysis passes. Until now it had exactly one place to put things, and the
distinction between "the record's logic" and "SQLite" was never forced. specs/17
forces it: the desk keeps its one file under `~/Movies`, publicrecord keeps a
Postgres the towns share, and the same hand-audited issue engine has to run
against both and produce the same record.

So this is the line. Anything below it may differ between stores; anything
above it may not. `Corpus` (SQLite) satisfies this as written — that is the
acceptance test, not an aspiration — and `record.store.PgCorpus` implements it
beside.

It is a `Protocol`, not a base class, on purpose. `Corpus` is the most
hand-audited object in the tree and giving it a parent changes its MRO and its
`__init__` for no benefit; structural typing asks only that the methods match.
`isinstance(Corpus(...), CorpusStore)` is checked in the suite.

The four contracts a store cannot see for itself, written down for the first
time because a second implementation is the moment they start to matter:

**Ordering.** `list_meetings` and `list_documents` are newest-first with blank
dates last. `transcript` and `segments_of` are in `idx` order. `issue_appearances`
is oldest-first with blank dates first, and its beads are in `start` order —
`issues.delta` slices `beads[:30]` and `beads[:3]` and would quietly describe
the wrong moment if that changed. `list_events` is newest-first; `digest` calls
the first match "latest" and is only correct under it.

**Embeddings are opaque.** A store hands back whatever its column holds — raw
float32 bytes at the desk, a pgvector array in publicrecord. Callers read them
only through `embed.as_vec()`. No caller may assume `bytes`, and none may
assume a dimension: `embed.DIM` is the single source of truth and there is no
dim tag on the desk's blobs, so a mismatch raises a shape error rather than
degrading. A zero-norm vector (3.2% of the live corpus — segments that are
`[music]` or pure filler) is stored as absent, not as zeros, and never appears
in a vector result on either store.

**None is not empty string.** `transcript()` promises `speaker: None` for an
unattributed segment, never `""`. The desk gets this from `r["speaker"] or None`;
a store with a `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` column owes the same conversion.

**Ids are opaque tokens.** Segment, chunk, event and vote ids are unique
positive integers, stable for the row's lifetime. Nothing may assume density,
contiguity, or that a higher id means a later row — SQLite's AUTOINCREMENT and
a Postgres identity column gap differently, and the engine treats them as
tokens everywhere.
