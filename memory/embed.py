"""A small, honest, offline text embedding.

The spec wants "semantic + keyword" search. Keyword is SQLite FTS5 (exact,
fast, in store.py). This file is the *related-language* half: a fixed-width
vector built from hashed word and character n-grams, L2-normalised, so two
segments that talk about the same thing in different words still land near each
other. It downloads nothing, needs no model, and runs on old hardware — the
covenant made literal. It is lexical, not neural, and the UI says so.

`embed()` is the single seam: when a local neural model earns its keep on the
cluster, swap the body here and every caller — store search, the context API —
inherits it with no other change.

Hashing uses blake2b, not Python's salted builtin `hash()`, so a vector
written today matches one computed in a fresh process tomorrow. That stability
is load-bearing: the vectors live in the database.
