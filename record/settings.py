"""Configuration from the environment, and nowhere else.

The desk reads its settings out of `~/Library/Application Support` and writes
its media under `~/Movies`; `czcore.paths` will happily *create* those
directories as a side effect of being asked where they are. None of that has
any meaning in a container, so none of it is imported here.

Secrets arrive as environment variables — from Secret Manager in publicrecord,
from a `.env` the developer never commits locally. Nothing in this file has a
secret as its default, and `redacted()` exists so a store can say which
database it is talking to without putting a password in a log line.
