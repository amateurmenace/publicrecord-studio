"""Publicrecord's HTTP surface — small on purpose.

The reader is static. That is not a limitation being worked around; it is the
resilience answer and the cost answer in one move (specs/17 §6.2). The pressed
edition carries the meetings, the issues, the timelines, the ledgers and the
lexical search index, and it reads with this service dead, the database gone,
and the aeroplane mode on. So the API's job is only the part an envelope of
static files structurally cannot hold:

  · **semantic search**, which needs a vector index at query time — the one
    feature that is publicrecord's whole reason to have a server;
  · **freshness**, so a reader looking at yesterday's pressing can be told a
    newer one exists rather than silently reading history;
  · **submissions**, so "Add a meeting" finally POSTs instead of composing a
    GitHub issue — the specs/16 contract shape unchanged, landing in a queue;
  · **the steward console**, behind Google sign-in, which is the only place
    anybody logs into anything.

Everything else the reader wants, it already has on disk.

**No reader is identified, counted, or followed here.** There is no cookie, no
session, no analytics, no fingerprint, and the public endpoints take no
identity and set no state. The server logs what Cloud Run logs — operational,
rotated, never product data (specs/17 §9). If a future endpoint needs to know
who is reading, it is the wrong endpoint.

Every public response says what it could not do rather than quietly doing less:
a search with the neural half unavailable reports `"space": "lexical"` and a
sentence, and the reader prints it. Degrading is allowed; degrading silently is
not.

    # nobody but a steward requests — rather than a hole in the reader's.
    # Note what stays strict even here: `script-src` has no 'unsafe-inline'
    # and no 'unsafe-eval', so console.js is the only code that can run, and
    # `connect-src` still names only ourselves and Google. `style-src` does

        The client id is not a secret: Google's whole design puts it in the
        markup of every page that renders a sign-in button. The allowlist is
        a secret and is never in this response — who the stewards are is not
        the browser's business, and 403 already tells a signed-in stranger
        the only thing they need to hear.

        When nothing is configured this answers 200 with `configured: false`
        rather than 503, because "there is no console here" is a true and
        successful answer to the question the page asked. The steward API
