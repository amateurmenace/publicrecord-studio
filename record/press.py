"""Press the edition from the cloud — the record, on paper, without us.

specs/17 §6.2 makes one promise and everything in this file serves it: **if
Cloud Run and Postgres both vanish, the record still reads.** Publicrecord is
allowed to be clever — semantic search needs a server, and that is the whole
reason there is one — but the reading of the record is not allowed to depend
on publicrecord being alive. So on every corpus change, debounced, the same
specs/16 edition the desk presses is pressed here and pushed to a bucket
behind a CDN, and the reader shell talks to the API for exactly two things
(meaning-search and freshness) and to the bucket for everything else.

**The choice this module had to make.** `web.bake.bake()` takes a path to a
SQLite file, and a `PgCorpus` is not one. The tempting fix is to export the
Postgres record to a temporary `corpus.db` and bake that. Reading the code
says otherwise: `bake()` is a fourteen-line wrapper whose only real work is
`Corpus(corpus_db)`, and the press itself is the `Bake` class — which takes a
corpus *object* and was written against the store's methods, not against
SQLite. Every call it makes (`list_meetings`, `get_meeting`, `transcript`,
`votes_of`, `list_documents`, `list_issues`, `issue_appearances`,
`issue_paper`, `list_events`, `stats`, `all_votes` via `memory.votes`) is in
`memory.seam.CorpusStore`, and `PgCorpus` implements that interface — that is
what the seam was extracted for. So `Bake` is handed the corpus it already
knows how to read, and no copy of the record is written to a disk in order to
be read straight back off it.

That choice has a cost and it is carried in the open rather than hidden:
`press()` transcribes `bake()`'s orchestration — its nine stage calls, in
order — so a stage added to `web/bake.py` must be added here too or the
hosted edition quietly ships one plane fewer than the desk's. The alternative
was worse in a way that compounds: a corpus that will hold hundreds of
meetings, written out to `/tmp` in full on every press, so that a signature
could be satisfied.

**Two things the desk supplies that a container cannot.** `bake()` passes
`czcore.paths.media_dir`, which resolves `~/Movies` and *creates* directories
as a side effect of being asked where they are; `settings.py` already refuses
to import it for that reason. It is used for one purpose — finding the
Interpreter and Narrator sidecar tracks a desk wrote beside a meeting — and
publicrecord has no sidecars, because nothing has ever transcribed or described
a meeting on this machine. So press passes a resolver that points at a path
that does not exist, the track scan finds nothing, and the pressed edition
carries no translated or described tracks. It says so: `sidecars` is False in
the return value. That is the honest shape of the gap until the drain
(specs/17 §6.4) posts tracks back.

**`edition_date` is the record's date, and must not become the press date.**
The bake derives it from `max(meeting date)` on purpose, and
`tests/test_web_bake.py::TestIdempotence` holds it there: the same corpus
presses byte-identical bytes, which is what makes a re-press free — the sync
below compares digests and uploads nothing when nothing moved. A hosted
record still owes the reader an answer to "is this current?", and that answer
is a *different* fact with a *different* name. It lives in `pressing.json`
beside the manifest, it carries a wall clock, and it is the only file in an
edition that does — which is exactly why it is a separate file and not a
field in `manifest.json`.

**The sync gzips, because nobody else will.** `web/bake.py` writes its JSON
plain and says why: GitHub Pages and Fastly gzip text on the wire, so the
reader is a plain fetch. GCS behind a Cloud Load Balancer does not do that by
default — it serves the bytes it was given. An edition of the live corpus is
about 29 MB raw and `search/segs.json` is fetched *in full* on every search,
so shipping it plain would move the entire cost of the covenant's "no
backend" onto the reader's phone. So the sync pre-compresses text objects and
sets `Content-Encoding: gzip` on them, and the origin is correct rather than
the CDN being lucky.

Nothing here calls a model. The press is the one pipeline stage with no AI in
it — deterministic, extractive, the record restated — so it writes no row to
the `spend` table, and a steward reading that ledger will correctly find the
nightly pressing absent from it.

    Deletes are not optional. A meeting taken down under the takedown policy
    (specs/17 §7), a corpus re-import that renames an id, an issue merged
    away: each removes files from the pressed edition, and a sync that only
    ever uploads would leave those pages reachable at their old URLs forever
    — the record's own index would stop pointing at them while the CDN went
    on serving them. So anything under the prefix that the press did not
    write is removed — with one named exception: under `stills/` (the
    pictures cache, specs/29 §P0.2) an object is kept when its meeting is in
    `keep_pids` (the edition's live meetings), pressed tonight or not, so a
    night whose fetch failed cannot empty the cache; a taken-down meeting's
    stills are removed with its pages. With `keep_pids` None every still is
    kept.

    That makes an empty or half-written source directory catastrophic, so it
    is refused: `manifest.json` is the sentinel every successful press
    produces, and without it this returns `ok: False` and touches nothing. A
    press that produced no manifest is a bug, not an empty record.

    Uploads run before deletes, always. A sync that dies halfway through then
    leaves a *superset* of the record in the bucket, which reads; the other
    order leaves holes, which 404.

    Text objects are pre-compressed and marked `Content-Encoding: gzip` —
    see this module's docstring — and everything carries the digest of its
    plain bytes in object metadata, so the next night's sync uploads only
    what actually changed.

    `google-cloud-storage` is optional, as is having credentials. Without
    either, this returns `{"ok": False, "reason": ...}`; the edition is still
