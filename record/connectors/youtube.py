"""The nightly poll — a town's channel, read the way a subscriber reads it.

A town publishes its meetings to its own YouTube channel and, without being
asked, publishes a machine-readable list of them beside it: the channel's Atom
feed. Fifteen entries, no API key, no quota, no binary, no scraping — the same
URL a podcast client would poll. That is the whole of this connector's
discovery surface, and the narrowing is deliberate.

specs/17 §14 asked whether yt-dlp's rate and ToS posture survives nightly-poll
volume. The answer taken here is to not find out. yt-dlp is a download tool
wearing a metadata tool's hat, and aiming it at every town every night is
precisely the traffic shape that gets a project's addresses walled — after
which the record stops arriving and nobody can say why. RSS is the polite
citizen's route: it exists in order to be polled. Discovery costs one GET per
body per night, and the only per-video request is the watch page whose caption
list the record genuinely needs.

**The connector does not ingest, and that is the design rather than a
limitation.** It files rows in `submissions` at status `submitted` and stops.
A steward approves; the pipeline ingests. specs/17 §5 made that a state
machine on purpose, because a poller that ingests whatever it finds is a
poller that can put the wrong town's budget hearing on the public record at
three in the morning with nobody awake to notice. The cost is bought
deliberately: a meeting waits in a queue for as long as a human takes, and the
spec accepts that latency in exchange for nothing ever landing unread.

**A video with no captions is reported, never skipped.** Silence is the one
failure mode a nightly job must not have — a body whose captions quietly
stopped would look, in a log of clean runs, exactly like a body that stopped
meeting. So the probe's verdict travels back in `errors` as a labeled entry
and into the submission's own note, where a steward will read it. And the
probe answers three ways, not two: captions found, captions definitively
absent, or *not known* — because a throttled fetch that reported "no captions"
would be a lie that costs a meeting.

What this connector will **not** do is write the `asr_tasks` row itself. An
ASR task is work queued against a meeting, and no meeting exists yet; filing
one here would be ingest through the back door, past the approval the
paragraph above exists to protect. That row belongs to the ingest stage, once
a human has said yes (specs/17 §6.4) — and it is a drain ticket, never a GPU
bill.

**Backoff is a value that surfaces, not a sleep that hides.** `Throttled`
carries the status, the attempt count and the wait; `discover` turns it into
an error entry rather than an exception; so the steward console can say *this
town's source is throttling* instead of showing a town that has mysteriously
stopped holding meetings.

Nothing here spends money. An Atom feed is free and captions are words the
town already published, so this connector writes no `spend` row — which keeps
the ledger meaning exactly what it says it means about the passes that do.
