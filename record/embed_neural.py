"""Meaning, bought by the batch — the neural half, and why it is optional.

`memory/embed.py` ends with a promise: it calls itself a seam, and says that
when a real model earns its keep, "swap the body here and every caller inherits
it". This is that swap, made in the one place it can be afforded — a server
with a bill attached — and made *beside* the lexical vector rather than instead
of it.

That word beside is the whole design. The desk's 256-dimension hashed vector
downloads nothing, needs no key, and runs on old hardware; it is the covenant
made literal, and it stays the default and the fallback everywhere. What Gemini
buys is the one thing hashing structurally cannot do: two passages about the
same subject in entirely different words. So publicrecord keeps both columns,
search blends both and tells the reader which found what, and an edition is
pressed from neither — `emb_neural` is the single column the record can lose
without losing anything it promised anyone.

Which is why nothing in this file raises. A key that was never set, a key that
was revoked, a 503 at two in the morning, a package that is not installed:
every one of them returns None for that text and a number in the report, and
the record goes on searching lexically. The failure mode of a paid dependency
inside a civic archive has to be "less", never "down".

Two details are load-bearing and quiet enough to get wrong:

**The vectors arrive un-normalised.** `gemini-embedding-001` is trained
Matryoshka-style and 768 dimensions is a truncated prefix of its 3072; below
full width the API does not re-normalise what it hands back. `memory.embed
.cosine()` is a bare dot product, `policy.VECTOR_FLOOR` and every threshold in
the issue engine are calibrated against unit vectors, and pgvector's cosine
operator would keep working while every number above it drifted. So the L2
division happens here, on the way in, exactly once — and never on the way out,
where some later caller would forget it and nothing would complain.

**A dead vector is NULL, not zeros.** The same rule the lexical column obeys,
for the same reason: cosine distance against a zero vector is undefined, and
one NaN poisons an HNSW ordering silently, with no error anywhere.

The batch cap and the retry ladder are the cost tradeoff, stated plainly: a
hundred texts per call and three backed-off retries make a 300-meeting backfill
minutes and pennies instead of hours, and turn a transient outage into a pause
rather than a hole in the corpus. Every call that succeeds writes a row to
`spend` — the ledger is the covenant's arithmetic, and a number nobody can see
is a number nobody controls.
