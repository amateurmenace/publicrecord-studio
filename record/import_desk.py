"""corpus.db → publicrecord. A transliteration, never a re-derivation.

specs/17 §11.3 is explicit: *nothing is re-derived that was hand-audited*. The
Brookline corpus this imports was measured — 41 issues over two Select Board
meetings, every one of its 392 issue links made by exact alias match, its
segment vectors written by `memory/embed.py` and verified byte-for-byte. Running
`discover()` again on the other side would produce *a* set of issues; it would
not produce *these*, and the difference is a season of someone's judgement.

So this reads and writes. It does not cluster, it does not re-embed, it does not
re-assign, and it does not tidy. The 41 names come across as they are — including
`City Realy`, which is a caption garble that became a permanent issue id, and
`Anti Semitic`, which reads oddly as a label for what its member segments show
is a vandalism response. Those are wrong, and they are also the record as it
stands. The steward console's rename verb is the tool for them; fixing them here
would make the import publicrecord's first unaudited edit, which is exactly the
thing this file exists not to be.

Four conversions are unavoidable, and each is mechanical:

  · `emb BLOB` → `vector(256)`: `np.frombuffer(blob, "<f4")`, same numbers.
  · a zero-norm vector → NULL, because cosine distance against zero is undefined
    under pgvector and one NaN silently poisons an HNSW ordering. The desk stores
    those zeros and skips them on read; here they are simply absent.
  · `town` is denormalised onto segments and doc_chunks, read from the parent
    meeting — the column a hosted, multi-town search cannot do without.
  · `shingles` TEXT stays, exactly as the desk spells it, so tier-three dedupe
    compares the same strings on both stores.

And then it checks itself: every table counted, a sample of vectors re-read and
compared bit-for-bit against the source blobs, and the issue rollups diffed
between the two stores. An import that cannot prove it landed is a backup nobody
has restored.
