"""The corpus in Postgres — the same record, the same answers, other dialect.

This is `memory.seam.CorpusStore` a second time. It is deliberately structured
like `memory/store.py` method for method, so the two can be read side by side
and a divergence is visible rather than buried; and every judgement call it
makes comes from `memory/policy.py`, so the two cannot drift on *what* the
record means even when they differ on how to ask for it.

The four places the dialect genuinely bites, and what is done about each:

**`end` is a reserved word.** Not merely awkward — `s.end` is a syntax error in
Postgres, because the token after a dot must be a ColId. The column is `end_s`
and every read aliases it back to `"end"`, so callers, tests and the reader see
identical dict keys on both stores.

**bm25 is negative, ts_rank_cd is positive.** SQLite orders keyword hits
ascending by a negative score; Postgres orders descending by a positive one.
Porting the ORDER BY across would return the *worst* matches first and, because
the score is rank-derived, corrupt every number in the result with no error
anywhere. `policy.rank_scores` takes an ordering and makes the numbers, so each
store owes only a correct sort.

**A connection is no longer free.** The desk opens one per operation — a search
costs it something like 121 of them, which is microseconds against a local file
and a catastrophe across a network. So: a pool, and the meeting JOIN folded
into the search queries rather than resolved per hit.

**Vectors are typed.** `emb` is a `vector(256)` rather than a blob of float32,
and a zero-norm vector is stored as NULL rather than as zeros — cosine distance
against a zero vector is undefined, and one NaN poisons an HNSW ordering
silently. `memory.embed.as_vec` reads either shape, which is why the engine
above the seam never learns which store it is talking to.

        """Nearest neighbours by cosine, through the HNSW index — and it takes
        a subquery to keep the index in play.

        The obvious query is one SELECT: join segments to meetings, filter,
        `ORDER BY emb_neural <=> q LIMIT k`. It is also a trap. The planner
        cannot push an ordered index scan through the join, so it computes the
        distance for **every** embedded segment and top-N sorts the lot.
        Measured on the live record: 2s became 45s the moment the LIMIT crossed
        the index's reach, on the same query, with nothing else running — a
        cliff, which is what made it read as contention until the numbers were
        taken twice.

        So the vector ordering runs in a subquery over `segments` alone, where
        the HNSW index is the only sensible plan and returns `k` candidates
        instead of scanning eighty thousand. Every filter — `status`, `town`,
        `body` — lives on `meetings` and applies *outside* the subquery, after
        the index has chosen, so the subquery over-fetches to cover what the
        outer filter drops. This is the standard approximate-NN-with-post-filter
        shape: under a tight scope it may return fewer than `k`, which is honest
        — the index looked at a bounded neighbourhood and that is what was in it.

        The filter must be `m.town`, never the `town` denormalised onto
        segments. That column lags a steward's town correction — two parity
        tests exist because it does — and the lexical path already scopes on
        `m.town`, so the two halves of one search have to agree on which town a
        meeting is in.

        `SET LOCAL` scopes `ef_search` to the transaction, so a pooled
        connection never carries one search's tuning into the next; it is capped
        at the parameter's own ceiling, above which Postgres refuses the value
        rather than clamping it."""
