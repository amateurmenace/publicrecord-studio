"""publicrecord.studio — the record, hosted (specs/17).

The desk presses editions; publicrecord keeps the record. Meetings arrive nightly
from the towns' own channels, the corpus lives in Postgres with pgvector,
search understands meaning as well as words, and a steward tends it from a
browser. No Mac in the loop — and the reader still never logs in.

What this package is *not* is a second engine. `memory/` is the civic-record
engine and stays that way: the issue clustering, the dedupe tiers, the vote
reader, the analysis passes are imported here, not reimplemented, so the
hand-audited logic produces the same record on both stores. What `record/` adds
is the half a desk never needed — a Postgres store behind the same seam, an
HTTP surface, connectors that poll, steward auth, and a press job.

Layout:
  settings.py     — configuration from the environment only. No ~/Movies, no
                    support_dir, nothing that assumes a home directory.
  store.py        — PgCorpus: memory.seam.CorpusStore over Postgres + pgvector.
  migrate.py      — numbered plain-SQL migrations, applied once, recorded.
  embed_neural.py — the neural half of search (Gemini, server-side, batched).
  import_desk.py  — corpus.db → publicrecord, transliterated, never re-derived.
  app.py          — the FastAPI service: search, submissions, freshness.
  auth.py         — Google Sign-In, allowlist, stewards only.
  steward.py      — the eight curation verbs, behind auth, with an audit log.
  press.py        — presses the specs/16 edition on corpus change.
  connectors/     — the towns' own channels, polled politely.

The covenant, translated up (specs/17 §9): readers get no accounts, no
tracking, no analytics, no fingerprinting. Accounts exist for stewards only.
The edition remains downloadable whole. The server spends the project's money,
never the reader's identity.
