"""The shared-paper store — content-addressed, write-once, read-only.

specs/21 §6.2, the one server touch a curated paper can have. A paper is PUT
by the hash of its own canonical bytes, so the URL *is* the content: the same
paper always lands at the same address, a re-share is a no-op, and nothing at
this layer knows or asks who wrote or reads one. The store is **additive,
never load-bearing** — every paper also travels as a URL-encoded link and an
exportable ``paper.json``, so losing this bucket loses the shortness of the
short links and nothing else (specs/17 §6.2 holds whole).

The abuse posture, P1 (settled with Stephen 2026-07-21) and extended for P2
(notes, settled 2026-07-22): the free text a stored paper may carry is its
**title** and its **notes** — each length-capped, plain text, control-char
policed (a note may hold newlines; a title may not); every other field is an
exact-shaped reference into the record (a pid, a slug, a clip's two
timestamps, a chart kind from a closed list). Validation is **strict, not
corrective** — an
unknown key or a malformed block is a 422, never silently rewritten, because
a store that "helpfully" edits documents stores things nobody ever saw. (The
reader's own decoder is the opposite — total, malformed-degrades — and that
is the right split: a *link* must survive a mangling email client; a *store*
must refuse to hold what the client never meant.)

Canonical form is decided HERE and only here: keys sorted, separators tight,
ASCII-escaped, clip times snapped to the tenth-second grid with whole seconds
collapsed to ints (``12``, ``12.0`` and ``12.00`` are one clip, one hash).
The client never computes the hash — it POSTs the portable form and receives
the address back — so there is no cross-language byte contract to drift.

Takedown: there is no delete API on purpose. A steward removes the object
``p/<id>.json`` from the bucket by hand (``record/OPERATING.md`` §papers),
and the address goes honestly 404.
