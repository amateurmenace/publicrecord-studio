"""Redirect stubs, for the day the record changes address — and not before.

specs/17 §11.4: `control-z.org/app/*` becomes redirect stubs into publicrecord,
so every civic citation minted so far survives. Those citations are the point.
A resident who pasted a deep link into a comment letter in June, a reporter who
footnoted a timestamp, the town's own agenda packet linking a moment — none of
them will be re-issued, and a 404 is the record forgetting something it
promised to keep.

Which is exactly why this is a command and not a step that already ran.
**Redirecting a working edition at a Studio that does not exist yet would break
every one of those links to fix a problem nobody has.** Nothing here runs until
`communityai.studio` actually serves the record; the runbook
(`record/INFRA.md`) puts it after DNS.

The stubs are deliberately dumb: a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` and a real
`<a>`, because GitHub Pages serves no redirect headers and a reader with
JavaScript off must still be able to follow the link by hand. Each one carries
the path it came from, so `control-z.org/app/i/vision-zero` lands on the same
issue in publicrecord rather than dumping everyone at a home page — a redirect
that loses the deep link is only half a promise kept.

    python -m record.redirect --edition site/docs/app --to https://communityai.studio
    python -m record.redirect --edition site/docs/app --to ... --write
