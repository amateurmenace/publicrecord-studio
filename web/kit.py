"""Publisher's reading half, pressed (specs/20 §6, §7.9 P2).

The desk's Publisher takes a program file and hands a producer a kit: the
clips worth cutting, and draft copy to ship them with. Everything in that kit
that can be *read* — the candidate clips, the extractive titles and
description, the chapter list — is a pure function of the transcript, and the
transcript is already on the record. So the press assembles the same kit here,
out of the moments plane the bake already wrote, and pages it at `/app/k/<pid>`
for anyone who wants to see what a meeting's publish kit would hold.

What stays at the desk is exactly what the covenant says stays there: the
render. `files` is empty and the page says why — cutting the clips, burning
captions and choosing ratios happen in Publisher, on the producer's own
machine, against local media the web app never uploaded. The emitted
`kit.json` is a real Publisher kit: a producer downloads it, opens it at the
desk, and continues from the draft rather than a blank page.

No model runs here. The copy is `czcore.kit.copy_extractive` — assembled from
the transcript, labeled so — the same core the desk uses, so a kit read on the
record and a kit opened at the desk are the same object. Pure over the pressed
meeting → the edition stays byte-idempotent.
