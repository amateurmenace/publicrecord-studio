"""HTML stubs + static assets for the edition.

Every stub is a complete, readable document with JavaScript OFF — the meeting's
transcript is real HTML, the issue's timeline is a real list of links, and the
head carries OG/Twitter tags so a link unfurls in a group chat with the
meeting's name, date, and thumbnail (specs/16 §P0.2). app.js then hydrates the
same DOM (adds the player facade, cite, search, the language menu) without
tearing the transcript down — progressive enhancement, so JS-off passes the
acceptance click-paths natively.

CSP is machine-enforced via a <meta http-equiv> tag on every page: default-src
'self', frames only to youtube-nocookie, images 'self' + i.ytimg.com. No
third-party script, font, or beacon rides in.

    <h1>Our AI Constitution</h1>
    <p class="presslede">Making a tool once required permission — a degree, a
      department, a budget line. AI collapses the distance between wishing a
      tool existed and building it: anyone who understands a problem can now
      build the thing that meets it. Toolmaking, the oldest civic craft,
      becomes available to everyone. But that potential won't bend toward the
      public good on its own — not while the companies building AI are the only
      ones deciding what it's for. This page is what deciding for ourselves
      looks like: every place a model touches this record, named; every promise,
      checkable.</p>

    <a class="aiband" href="{COMMUNITYAI}">
      <span class="aiband-kicker">part of the Community AI Project</span>
      <span class="aiband-line">A live experiment in taking hold of AI and
        pointing it at civic life — open-source, locally-owned tools, deployed

    <div class="sectionhead"><span class="kicker">the articles — what we
      promise, and how to check us</span></div>
    <ol class="ailist">
      <li><b>The record is the source.</b> Models summarize, find, and label;
        they never replace the transcript. Every AI-made line sits beside the
        record it came from, and points back to it.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>Open any meeting: the
          summary is one labeled paragraph above the complete transcript, and
          every moment deep-links a timestamp on the tape.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>Disclosure at the point of use.</b> Anything a model wrote is
        labeled where you read it — “AI summary” on the page,
        <code>ai:&lt;model&gt;</code> in the data. Nothing AI-made is passed
        off as the record.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>Every meeting's own
          plane (<code>meetings/&lt;id&gt;.json</code>) carries a
          <code>summary_origin</code> field: <code>ai:&lt;model&gt;</code>
          when a model drafted it, <code>extractive</code> when the sentences
          came from the transcript itself.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>Reading never requires AI.</b> Meaning search is an upgrade, not
        a dependency: when the model is off, the static keyword index answers
        and the page says so. Every page reads with every server gone.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>Search the record,
          then search it again offline — the results say which index answered.
          The <a href="/app/covenant">covenant</a> holds the larger promise:
          static files only.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>Readers are never fed to models.</b> The models see public record
        text — transcripts, agendas, minutes — and, for search, the words of
        your query alone. Never anything about you: no account, cookie, or
        analytics exists here to share.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>The
          <a href="/app/covenant">covenant</a> is enforced by a strict
          Content-Security-Policy on every page — no third-party script or
          beacon can load, and the search call carries no identity.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>People gate the record.</b> Nothing enters on a model's say-so: a
        steward approves every submitted meeting — in person, or by a standing
        rule the steward wrote for a channel they trust, which approves only a
        meeting YouTube's own list carries captions for; the record's audit
        names the rule the way it names a person. Corrections annotate, never
        rewrite. AI drafts; people decide.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>Submit a meeting from
          <a href="/app/add">the add page</a> — the reply says a steward
          reviews it before the record updates. A standing rule reaches only
          the nightly poll of a channel a steward configured; it never touches
          what a person submits.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>Local first where it counts.</b> The desk tools run their models
        on your machine — noise reduction, voice isolation, rotoscoping — and
        nothing leaves the room. The hosted record uses a cloud model only
        where static files structurally cannot (embedding a search query at
        the moment you ask it), and names the model it uses.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>Install the desk from
          <a href="/app/press">the press</a> — then unplug the network and cut
          a film. It all still works.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>Open to audit.</b> The code that pressed this page — prompts,
        gates, fallbacks — is public under AGPL-3.0, a license whose purpose
        is that a public thing stays public. A constitution nobody can audit
        is a press release.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>The source is at
          <a href="{SOURCE_REPO}">github.com/amateurmenace/publicrecord-studio</a>;
          which license covers which part is in
          <a href="{LICENSING_DOC}">LICENSING.md</a>.</p></details></li>
      <li><b>Built with AI, signed by people.</b> This software is itself
        developed with AI assistance — the same collapse of distance we argue
        for is how a tiny shop built a record this size. Every change lands in
        a public commit a person reviewed and signed.
        <details><summary>check it yourself</summary><p>The commit history is
